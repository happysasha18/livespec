# livespec Journal

Edit history lives here — the WHY behind every change. The spec and README state current truth; this file explains how we got there.

## 2026-07-04 — Package born

**What:** Created the livespec skeleton repo — directory structure, four bundled skills, templates, adopt procedure, guardrails outline, install script.

**Why:** The method (spec → prove → reconcile → matrix → test → code → verify → commit) has been running in production on track-coach for over a year and is proven. It lives scattered: CLAUDE.md rules, four skill repos, a playbook, and a habit. The goal of livespec is to make the whole thing one attachable package — clone it, run `./install.sh`, and the skills land in `~/.claude/skills/` ready for any project. One home, not four.

**Why "livespec":** Alexander's coinage (2026-07-04). Working name; a better name may emerge (queued in ROADMAP).

**Status:** Skeleton only. Skills are read-only copies (source repos unchanged). No SPEC authored yet — that waits for Alexander's signal to publish, so spec-author runs on the full intended scope, not a moving target. Unpublished; local only.

**Decided:** Local-only for now. No GitHub creation, no push. When Alexander says publish, that is ROADMAP item 1 — create the repo, push, wire the skill install to the real source.

## 2026-07-04 — SPEC v0.1: the first self-application run
Alexander caught a real hole in ADOPT (it inventoried code but not existing DOCUMENTS) and added two more
wishes (attic-not-delete; version-control gate). Instead of patching ADOPT.md pointwise, livespec was run
on itself: three wishes → queue rows 8-10 → SPEC.md v0.1 authored covering the whole package (wish
lifecycle, both entry modes, actors, milestones, self-application invariant M-4). ADOPT.md and README will
be updated AFTER the prover pass (row 7) — spec before docs, by the book.

## 2026-07-04 — prover pass (row 7) + the honesty correction
FULL product-prover pass over SPEC v0.1: 11 findings (wish exit states; preemption path; surface-registry
entity; current-vs-target marking; profile owner+trust rule; provenance reconcile transition; baseline
advance timing; INV homes; human-gate re-listing; skill-version drift; checkpoint home). All folded → v0.2.
Alexander then challenged the "pioneers / no prior art" claim as possible people-pleasing. He is partly
right: artifact-baseline diffing is MATURE prior art in testing tooling (Jest snapshots, Percy, Chromatic
visual regression). Our narrower true claim: declared-scope diff as an agent pre-push guardrail + the
continuous-intake combination. README rewritten to credit lineage and link BMAD; long-tail search of the
skill ecosystem launched before publish.

## 2026-07-04 — first REAL adopt run (tlvphoto) + dogfood fix to ADOPT.md (row 4)
Ran the adopt procedure end-to-end on a live project (tlvphoto: 7.7 GB, ~18 docs, no git). Landed
non-destructively: git baseline (media/venv gitignored), `.livespec/` (profile + skill commits), a surface
registry (30 surfaces) and a TEST_MATRIX from the host's proven SPEC (all TODO — the data rows double as the
host's next sprint's acceptance), then 7 superseded docs → `attic/` with a manifest (Alexander OK), live
current-state pointers repointed. tlvphoto was already authored in the method, so re-engineering rewrote
nothing — adoption was light, which is the intended outcome for a well-run host.

**Why this changed livespec itself:** the run proved `adopt/ADOPT.md` was STALE vs SPEC (it still had the old
inventory→reverse-spec→snapshot order, missing orient/attic/VCS-gate). Rewrote ADOPT.md to the SPEC A-0…A-7
sequence. One genuine refinement the run surfaced and I folded: the **version-control gate belongs FIRST**
(before orient touches anything) so the whole run is reversible — annotated SPEC A-0/A-5 (codes name
meanings, not a frozen order). A re-prove of the adopt section is due at the next milestone (minor reorder,
not blocking). Closes ROADMAP row 4; completes the "update ADOPT.md to the proven spec" tail of row 7.
Note: livespec repo was concurrently edited by another session (publish + rows 12-15) — this entry touched
only ADOPT.md, SPEC A-0/A-5, ROADMAP row 4, and this journal.
