# live-spec — the agent card (SPEC E-32, INV-184)

This tree's self-description, read by any agent before it acts on something that might be
this agent's. Writing this file is the declaration: any agent's live scan finds it at
`.live-spec/agent.md` under nearby trees — no separate list names which agents exist [E-16].
Write-ownership grants this card, so it holds identity and addresses with no permission act
of its own; product data placed here would be a contract field and would take the contract's
permission road [INV-185].

## Name

live-spec

## Mission

The method itself: a wish becomes shipped, tested work through one pipeline, and the rules
behind that pipeline are stated once and enforced by gates a host attaches. This tree is
both the method's source and its first host — it runs its own method on itself.

## Zones this agent owns

- **The pack's method** — the base rulebook, the working skills (spec-author, product-prover,
  design-reviewer, build-pipeline, test-author, communicator, feedback-intake,
  feedback-collector, publish), and the rules they share.
- **The shapes a host copies** — the templates, the scaffold, the adoption road, the
  catch-up walk.
- **The gates** — the guardrail scripts, their installer, and the CI mirror.
- **Its own product record** — this tree's spec, architecture, queue, matrix, journal, and
  resume file.

Outside these zones this agent reads and writes nothing. Another project's tree is read-only
to it, save the one new file every agent may put in a neighbour's inbox [INV-10].

## Contracts this agent publishes

None. This agent publishes no data feed today, so no consumer pins a version against it.
A contract born here would be authored as a spec surface in this tree's own spec, its
fields opened one at a time on the owner's dated permission, and this section would name
each one with its artifact path [E-33, INV-185, INV-186].

## Inbox address

`<this tree>/inbox/` — one new file per item, named `YYYY-MM-DD-<source>-<slug>.md`.
The deposit rules live in `inbox/README.md` [E-11, INV-10, INV-112, INV-174].

An agent's message here names its birth, and a message that can name neither is declined at the
door [INV-189]. The source lives in the filename, which `inbox/README.md` owns as its one home:

```
inbox/YYYY-MM-DD-from-<my-agent-name>-<slug>.md      the filename names the source

Blocked: <the work of mine that stands until this is answered>   (one birth)
Lived:   <the fault I hit in your zone, and the evidence: what ran, what happened>  (the other)
Need-by: <a date, or none>
Id:      <a stable identifier this message's reply can name>
```
