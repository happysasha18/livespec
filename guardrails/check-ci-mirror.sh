# check-ci-mirror.sh — the CI mirror carries every local gate (SPEC INV-210, gate u).
#
# The push gate lives twice: guardrails/pre-push runs it on this machine, and
# .github/workflows/gates.yml re-runs it in CI as the second, any-machine net (SPEC M-5).
# gates.yml is hand-maintained, so it drifts the moment a gate is added locally and the CI
# file is not touched — the worked instance: gates h, k, and n were missing from CI on
# 2026-07-18, so a push a green CI would wave through could still fail the local gate.
#
# This check reads the gate letters pre-push invokes (the "-- gate X:" markers) and the gate
# letters gates.yml invokes (the "gate X" tokens in its step names), subtracts the declared CI
# carve-outs (guardrails/ci-mirror.json — the gates a CI checkout legitimately cannot or need
# not re-run, each with its reason), and reds on any local gate letter missing from CI, naming
# the gate and the one fix. It is the kin of config-health (gate m): that proves the installed
# hook matches its source, this proves the CI mirror matches the source too.
