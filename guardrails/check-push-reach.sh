# check-push-reach.sh — the reach map's deciding script (SPEC INV-45, ROADMAP row 147;
# scoped middle road ROADMAP row 362, SPEC M-344).
# Answers ONE question for the push gate: can this push's diff reach the python suite?
#   exit 0 = prose-only diff — every changed file matches the explicit prose class below;
#            the suite's checks read none of these files, gate b may stand the suite down BY NAME.
#   exit 2 = SCOPED — every changed file is PROSE or INFRA, and at least one is INFRA: the diff is
#            confined to the guardrail scripts, the scaffold checks, the shipped templates, the
#            helper scripts, the hooks, the guardrails config, or the suite's own test files. The
#            scoped test set is printed as `SCOPED <path>` lines (sorted, unique) plus one reason
#            line; gate b runs exactly that set instead of the whole suite.
#   exit 1 = full reach — at least one changed file is outside PROSE ∪ INFRA (code, spec, matrix,
#            queue, skills, scripts the map never met — or anything NEW), or an INFRA file names no
#            test (directly or via one referrer level), or the diff/base cannot be established.
#            Conservative by construction.
#
# The prose class is EXPLICIT and narrow — "just .md" is NOT a class: PRODUCT_SPEC.md, TEST_MATRIX.md,
# ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md, JOURNAL.md, NEXT_STEPS.md and every SKILL.md are TESTED documents
# (string rows read them) and must never be added below.
#
# The infra class is EXPLICIT too: guardrails/, scaffold/guardrails/, templates/, scripts/, hooks/,
# adopt/, the file guardrails.config.json, and tests/test_*.py files. A changed infra file's owning
# tests are found mechanically by filename — grep for the changed file's basename over tests/test_*.py
# — plus ONE referrer level: a file under one of the infra dirs that names the changed file's basename
# adds the tests that name THAT referrer's own basename. tests/test_traceability.py (the traceability
# net) always rides along — pinned as the first permanent member of ALWAYS_SCOPED below, an integrity
# rider. A changed infra file that no test names (directly or via a referrer) is not
# safely scopable, so the whole diff falls back to FULL — the conservative teeth this road keeps.
#
# Usage: check-push-reach.sh [base-ref]      (default base: origin/main)
#   REACH_FILES (tests only): newline-separated file list replaces the git diff.

# --- reach classes as host config (SPEC INV-224, ROADMAP row 380) ---------------------------
# The infra directories, prose files, and referrer directories the classifier sorts a changed
# file into are the HOST's to declare, not this script's to hold as constants: they are read
# from guardrails.config.json under `reach_classes`, the pack's own values shipped there as the
# default. A host whose layout differs — a product engine kept under scripts/, not helper tools
# — declares its own classes there once (the same knowledge project.layers carries, SPEC
# INV-135) and this vendored script needs no edit. REACH_CONFIG overrides the path (tests only).
# The conservative floor holds by construction: a config that names no classes leaves every
# changed file unclassified, so matches_prose/matches_infra both return false and the whole diff
# falls to FULL — never a false-green scope on a missing or empty config.
