"""check-touchpoint-kind.py — every point of contact with the person has a kind, and the kind decides
what may be said there (SPEC INV-205, ROADMAP 413).

Every touchpoint declares its kind in the manifest `guardrails/touchpoints.json`. A touchpoint is
SYNCHRONOUS when the person is present and the work waits on him (a live question, a decision page he is
looking at now), and ASYNCHRONOUS when he reads on his own clock while the work rolls (a status line,
the resume file, an inbox note, the waiting list he opens on request). The kind licenses the traffic:

  * an INTERRUPTION is afforded only on a synchronous point — interrupting a person who is absent is a
    loss, not a message;
  * a TEACHING line — one that introduces a capability he has not met — is afforded only where the
    person OPENS the point himself (any synchronous point, or an asynchronous point he opens on request),
    so the product teaches itself through use on a surface he chose to open;
  * WAITING traffic is afforded everywhere.

This gate reds a surface that speaks in a kind its touchpoint lacks: an interruption raised from an
asynchronous point, or a teaching line on a point the person did not open. A genuine touchpoint passes
quiet.

Usage:
  check-touchpoint-kind.py                      push mode: validate the manifest, then scan every
                                                declared surface that exists on disk (default, the gate).
  check-touchpoint-kind.py [--manifest FILE] FILE...
                                                scan one or more surface files, each against the
                                                touchpoint it declares (a `TOUCHPOINT-KIND: <name>`
                                                line) — used by the guardrail's own test over its
                                                fixtures.

A surface names its touchpoint with a `TOUCHPOINT-KIND: <name>` line and tags a line's traffic with an
`[[interrupt]]`, `[[teach]]`, or `[[wait]]` marker; an untagged line is waiting traffic by default.

Honest boundary: this reads a declared marker, not the meaning of an arbitrary line — a surface that
interrupts through wording the markers cannot read stays the author's own to declare. It is the
structural net that keeps the frame checkable, kin of check-cleanup-notice.sh and the muted-launch net.
