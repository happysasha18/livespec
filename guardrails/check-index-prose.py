"""check-index-prose.py — a Formal-index code is carried in its home prose (SPEC INV-218, gate x).

The first named instance of the vacuous-pass law (SPEC INV-218, ROADMAP 384). The Formal index
promises code → home: every anchor in the index is defined somewhere in the spec's prose. Today
`tests/test_traceability.py::test_spec_index_unique_anchors` checks uniqueness alone, so an index
row pointing at an EMPTY home — an anchor the prose never carries — passes. That is exactly the
defect the drafter's self-catch hit: minted codes absent from the prose, a scan comparing zero
against zero and reporting clean.

This gate declares its input set with the shared shape `guardrails/nonempty_input.py`: the
Formal-index anchors are expected non-empty, so an index that parses to zero anchors (the parser
broke, the section moved, the header was renamed) REDS BY NAME rather than passing over nothing.
Then, for each index anchor, it demands the prose body carries it — a range citation in the prose
(`T-1..T-7`) counting for its members, since the index states such a state group as one range.
An index anchor whose home prose never carries it reds, naming the anchor.

The gate reads PRODUCT_SPEC.md by default; `INDEX_PROSE_SPEC` overrides the path (the red-proof
points it at a fixture whose index is empty, and at one whose index anchor has no home). Kin of
the traceability suite's index checks, promoted to a push gate so the vacuous-pass never slips
back in between commits.
