"""check-wrong-referral.py — a wrong referral is named as the finding (SPEC INV-225).

Rule / INV-225 states it: a referral names the zone it says owns the question, and it is
WRONG when that zone does not own it. A wrong referral shows itself in the exchange — the
named zone refers the question back rather than answering it, and the question crosses the
same two agents twice, the event the two-crossing bound counts (SPEC INV-196). That bound
sends the third crossing to the owner and, today, names it neutrally ("a zone question the
two could not settle"), which absorbs the wrong referral without ever saying one was made.
This checker is the mechanical arm that NAMES it.

  What is mechanically tellable, and what is not. A wrong referral cannot be told from a
  legitimate cross-zone referral at the MOMENT of sending — both read "that lives in zone
  X's zone, ask X", and whether X's claim actually covers the target is a natural-language
  match, the receiving sweep's and the prover's judgment (SPEC INV-150, the honest split
  every net here keeps). It becomes tellable from the exchange's SHAPE: a referral the named
  zone answers, or an onward referral to a THIRD zone that then answers, reaches no cap and
  names nothing; a referral the named zone refers BACK — a counter-referral between the same
  two agents — is the wrong referral, proven wrong by the named zone's own act of referring
  it back. So the checker reads the shape, never the target-vs-claim match.

  The overlap half of the same audit finding is refused by the owner's word — two agents'
  zones may overlap and no forced disjointness is wanted (the promoter inbox deposit,
  2026-07-17) — so this checker builds NO uniqueness or overlap check; only the wrong
  referral earns a name.

  Not a push gate. Like the far-tier report-shape check (SPEC INV-222/INV-223), an exchange
  is a status-report surface the agents speak at runtime; no committed exchange file exists
  for a push gate to scan (a chat surface is not machine-gatable, SPEC INV-83's sibling). The
  suite drives this checker over fixtures to red-prove the shape.

Exchange format. One file per exchange, a hop per line (fenced blocks are examples and are
skipped, so a file quoting this help is not read as hops):

    <!-- exchange: <id> -->
    Hop: referral from <agent-a> to <agent-b>
    Hop: referral from <agent-b> to <agent-a>      <- counter-referral => wrong referral
    Hop: answer   from <agent-a>

  A `referral` hop names the zone it points at (its `to`). An `answer` hop needs no `to`.
  A wrong referral is a referral hop later met by a referral hop that reverses it (the same
  unordered pair, the other direction). A referral met by an answer, or an onward referral to
  a new zone that is then answered, passes.

Usage:
  check-wrong-referral.py FILE [FILE ...]
Exit 0 when no exchange carries a wrong referral; exit 1 (with file:line: findings) when one
does. Stdlib only.
