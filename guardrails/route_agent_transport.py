"""route_agent_transport.py — which transport carries a message between two agents (SPEC INV-236, ROADMAP 396).

INV-183's transport sentence was written on a refused premise: that git is the universal transport
for all inter-agent traffic and co-location only a fast path. The owner refused it 2026-07-17. The
cut runs by the traffic's KIND, not by where the two agents sit:

- A message needing no timely answer — a durable record a neighbour reads on its own clock, or a
  notification — travels by the STORE: the sender deposits one new file and the receiver sweeps it
  later, reachable while the receiver is not running and committed-and-pushed when the sender is
  remote [INV-112]. This road works today; the remote-deposit arm landed [ROADMAP 247].

- A conversation — a back-and-forth needing a live peer that answers in turn — needs a DIRECT
  CHANNEL, and the harness has not shipped one: the socket plumbing is built and switched off, no
  listener has shipped, so two local sessions have no live direct channel today.

The conversation road's availability is FIELD-GATED on the same machine-fact the listener tripwire
reads [INV-231]: a session record carrying a non-empty socket field is a listener. Today's
listenerless harness leaves the direct channel unavailable. The availability is read from the
session records, never hardcoded, so the day a listener ships the road flips to available on its
own — that day being row 405's mechanical tripwire.

WHERE IT LIVES. Like the listener tripwire, this rides the suite and takes NO push-gate letter: a
router is a stated routing rule a test exercises, not a committed file a push gate scans [INV-83].
