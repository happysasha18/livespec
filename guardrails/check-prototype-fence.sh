#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-prototype-fence.sh — gate (e) of the push gate: the prototype fence
# (SPEC INV-17 / E-17). A prototype lives in a fenced home (a `prototype/` folder);
# a PROD file referencing anything inside that home is RED at push.
#
# This gate catches STRUCTURAL wiring — a prod file naming/loading a fenced file
# (e.g. a <script src="prototype/sketch.html">, an import path, a link target) —
# not narrative mentions. Narrative homes are excluded by list: docs/, attic/,
# inbox/, JOURNAL.md, ROADMAP.md, NEXT_STEPS.md, and any README.md under
# guardrails/, plus .live-spec/ (this pack's own working state) — a project can
# talk ABOUT a prototype in its journal or docs without that being a wiring fault.
#
# Usage: check-prototype-fence.sh [repo-root] [fence-dir-name]
#   repo-root       defaults to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
#   fence-dir-name  defaults to "prototype" — a host renames its fence home by
#                   passing this argument (e.g. "sketches", "labs")
#
# If no fence directory exists (or it exists but is empty), there is nothing to
# fence yet: OK. Otherwise every file under the fence dir is grepped for, by its
# repo-relative path, across all git-tracked files outside the exclusion list;
# any hit is a structural reference into the fenced home and fails the gate.

# contract: BLOCKING gate (SPEC INV-47) — on red, one typed failure line beside the human lines.
