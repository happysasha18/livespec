"""check-release-note.py — a release note may offer the reader next-step choices, and the walk records
the offer-or-none decision (SPEC INV-228, ROADMAP 402).

A GitHub changelog / release note is a human-facing surface the reader opens himself — the release-note
touchpoint the frame declares [INV-205]: asynchronous, person-opened, a human audience with no answer
needed. On such a surface an OFFER is afforded — appealing next steps the reader may take, phrased as
CHOICES and never instructions. The offers section is OPTIONAL, so a release with no worthwhile next
step owes none; but the offer-or-none decision must be RECORDED, so the walk never silently forgets to
consider it.

This checker reads one release-note record and reds when the offer-or-none decision is left unrecorded —
a record that neither offers a next step nor records "no offer". A record that offers, or records "none"
by name, passes. The record's regions are keyed by machine markers, so a human's wording stays free:

  <!-- release-note:offers -->  ... offer lines (choices) ...  <!-- /release-note:offers -->
  <!-- release-note:no-offer -->   the recorded "no offer" decision

An offers region carrying at least one offer line is an offer; the no-offer marker is a recorded none;
a record with neither leaves the decision unrecorded and reds.

This checker is NOT in the pre-push chain. The release note the publish walk produces is a process
artifact the walk records at runtime, and no committed release-note file exists in the tree for a push
gate to scan — the sibling of the far-tier report-shape check [INV-83]. The suite drives it over
fixtures to red-prove the shape; the publish walk drives it over the release note it prepares.

Usage:
  check-release-note.py --note FILE    validate one release-note record's offer-or-none decision.
