"""check-listener-tripwire.py — the tripwire for the day the harness ships a listener (SPEC INV-231, ROADMAP 405).

The dormant socket plumbing — messagingSocketPath, the uds client, the local-session recipient kind —
is built and switched off in the harness, and a private HTTP broker daemon is not worth building to
bridge a few crossings a day. So the addressed-push channel waits on the harness itself shipping a
listener. Row 405 is a DEFERRED row carrying a mechanical revisit trigger: a session record in
`claude agents --json` (or the session registry) showing a NON-EMPTY socket field, re-scanned at every
queue-take under INV-129's existing habit. This script is the one-shot check that reads that field.

FIELD-GATED. It fires ONLY when a real session record actually carries a socket field — today's harness
ships none, so on a real machine it stays quiet. It never simulates a fired state as real; a test drives
a FIXTURE record through `LIVE_SPEC_AGENTS_JSON` so the mechanism is exercisable without waiting on the
harness. When it fires, it returns non-zero and prints a `TRIGGER-FIRED` line, so the queue-take that
runs it returns row 405 to the runnable head [INV-129]; the firing is the signal that the addressed-push
work is now buildable.

WHERE IT LIVES. It rides the queue-take scan and the suite, NOT the push chain: it takes no gate letter,
the way the far-tier report-shape check does [INV-222] — the trigger is a queue-cadence read, not a
committed file a push gate would scan.
