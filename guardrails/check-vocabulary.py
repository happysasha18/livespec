"""check-vocabulary.py — the closed-vocabulary gate (SPEC INV-254).

UNARMED until the spec-format conversion delivery (INV-270); no default file, the document is named on
the command line.

THE LAW (FORMAT.md law 1, INV-254): every domain noun the document deals in holds exactly ONE glossary
entry, and a coined word is translated to a defined standard term before it enters the document. This
gate holds the mechanically-decidable half of that law:

  - ONE ENTRY PER TERM. A glossary term defined twice reds — a thing carries one definition, not two.
  - NO DEAD ENTRY. A glossary term no body line uses reds (the gates-plan red case: "a glossary entry
    no body line uses") — a closed vocabulary carries only nouns the body actually deals in.
  - NO BANNED COINAGE. A coined word from `guardrails/spec-coinages.json` appearing anywhere in the
    document reds, naming the coinage and its standard replacement.

NOT MECHANICALLY CHECKED (reported, never silently skipped): the converse direction — "every domain
noun USED in the body has an entry" — is undecidable, because no script can enumerate which nouns in
free prose are domain nouns as against ordinary English (INV-254's own glossary draws that line by
hand). The cold-reader panel (Area 5) catches an undefined domain noun a reader trips on; the coinage
list is the machine's growing net for the ones already known.

Usage:
  check-vocabulary.py <document.md>
  VOCAB_COINAGES overrides the coinage-list path (the suite points it at a fixture list).
Exit 0 on a closed vocabulary (printing the reach line, INV-269); exit 1 naming each violation.
Stdlib only.
