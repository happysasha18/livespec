"""crosscut_counter — the boundary-health signal, mechanized (SPEC INV-128 boundary-health, INV-37 re-carve).

The boundary-health law states the bar and the signal: a right node boundary keeps a typical request in
one node, and repeated cross-cutting landings on the same node pair are the signal that a boundary sits in
the wrong place (ARCHITECTURE.md, SPEC INV-128). This counter is the mechanical half INV-128 deferred to a
follow-on row: it reads the closed queue's cross-cutting landings and counts, per unordered NODE PAIR, how
many cross-cutting changes touched both nodes. A pair reaching the threshold within the window is FLAGGED
for the MINOR audit as a boundary-move candidate — the mechanized form of "seen twice, own it" (base rule
19) applied to module boundaries.

The flag is an AUDIT SIGNAL, not a per-push red: a boundary moves only through the architecture step and
its re-prove (SPEC INV-37), never on a hunch and never on a bare count. So the `__main__` runner exits 0
always and prints the flagged pairs for the MINOR audit to weigh; it never blocks a push.
