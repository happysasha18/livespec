# check-tests.sh — gate (b) of the push gate: the test suite must be fully green.
#
# This also covers gate (c), anchor ownership: tests/test_traceability.py already
# asserts every spec anchor is owned by exactly one architecture node
# (TestArchitecture::test_architecture_owns_every_anchor_once). A green suite run
# proves both gates in one pass — no separate anchor-ownership check exists here.
#
# Scoped runs (SPEC INV-45, ROADMAP row 362): when env SCOPED_TEST_FILES is non-empty
# (newline-separated test file paths), only those files run — the reach map's SCOPED verdict
# already proved this set covers the diff.
#
# Suite wall-time budget (SPEC INV-41, INV-164, ROADMAP row 361): a green FULL default run (the
# real tests dir, no SCOPED_TEST_FILES, no LIVE_SPEC_SCRATCH) is followed by
# guardrails/check-suite-budget.sh reading this run's own captured log — a budget red makes this
# gate red too. A scoped or scratch run stands the budget check down by name: it is not the run
# the stated budget describes.
#
# Usage: check-tests.sh [tests-dir]
#   tests-dir defaults to "tests" (relative to the repo root, or an absolute path
#   for testing this gate against a scratch fixture without touching the real suite)
#   SCOPED_TEST_FILES (env, optional): newline-separated test file paths — run exactly these
#   instead of the whole tests-dir.
