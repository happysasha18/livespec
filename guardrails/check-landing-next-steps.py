"""check-landing-next-steps.py — the landing-refreshed-map gate (SPEC INV-242).

THE LAW. A "landing" commit owes a refresh of NEXT_STEPS.md in that SAME commit, since NEXT_STEPS.md
is the resume file (LIVE STATE + queue only) and a landing that does not update it leaves the next
session resuming from a stale map. Two triggers OR together, so both the pre-conversion history and the
post-conversion queue classify (SPEC INV-276, ROADMAP row 480):

  - the OLD trigger (pre-conversion body): the diff flips a ROADMAP.md row's Status cell to `landed`
    (case-insensitive) — the landed word lands as a live body status.
  - the NEW trigger (post-conversion live-body law): the diff REMOVES a body row from ROADMAP.md while
    a docs/queue-archive/*.md diff ADDS that same row number with an archived status containing `landed`
    (case-insensitive, so the historical bold `**LANDED**` and the new `*landed*` both match) — the row
    leaves the body for the archive at its closing commit.

A commit that closes no row, or moves a row out as `declined` / `superseded` / `deferred` (anything
without the `landed` token in the flipped or archived status), owes nothing here.

RANGE. Same base ladder as check-skill-review.sh / check-prover-record.sh: env LIVE_SPEC_DIFF_BASE
if set (and not the all-zeros sha) and it resolves to a commit; else origin/main if it resolves;
else HEAD~1. The range is BASE..HEAD, walked commit by commit via `git rev-list`.

DETECTION. For each commit, `git show <sha> -- ROADMAP.md` is read for its added (`+| ... |`) and
removed (`-| ... |`) table-row lines. A ROADMAP row is `| <num> | wish | class | STATUS | decision |`
— pipe-delimited, the Status cell the 4th cell between the pipes (index 3). A row number flips to
`landed` in this commit when an ADDED line for that number carries `landed` in its Status cell
while the REMOVED line for the same number did not (or there is no removed line at all — a row
born already `landed` counts too). The commit is a "landing" iff at least one row flips this way.

RED CONDITION. A landing commit whose changed-file list (`git show --name-only --format=`) does
not include NEXT_STEPS.md reds: exit nonzero, one JSON line per offending commit naming its
short sha, the flipped row number(s), and the fix.

This checker rides the suite rather than taking its own push-gate letter, because the push-gate
letters a–z are exhausted (INV-212's meta-guard requires every letter be classified). Riding the
suite is still enforcement at push: the suite is gate b, so a red here reds gate b and blocks the
push. Two suite tests cover it — a fixture-range test proving the detection logic, and a live-tree
test running it over this repo's real BASE..HEAD so the law is enforced against real commits, not
fixtures alone. It is deliberately NOT wired directly into guardrails/pre-push; see
tests/test_landing_next_steps.py::test_checker_not_wired_into_pre_push.
