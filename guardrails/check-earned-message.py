"""check-earned-message.py — the mechanical net for the earned message (SPEC INV-189).

Rule 31 / INV-189 states it: a message from one agent to another is born of the sender's
own work, and it names its birth in the message. The births are a closed set of two — the
sender is blocked by the receiver's zone as it stands, or the sender lived a fault in that
zone and carries the evidence it lived. A message that can name neither is never sent,
because curiosity, tidiness, and the thought that a neighbour might want to know each
describe a message the sender's own work does not need. Until now that was discipline
only, and discipline is what a long session spends first (base rule 30).

This gate is its mechanical arm. It reads the inbox as a folder of deposits, finds each
one an AGENT sent, and reds when such a deposit names neither birth. The red clears one of
two ways: the sender named the birth and the field was malformed, or the sweep declines the
message at the door and archives it. Declining at the door is the design's point — an
unearned message dies without a human reading it.

  Where the source lives. The filename holds it, and `inbox/README.md` is the home that
  prescribes the form (SPEC E-11):

    inbox/YYYY-MM-DD-from-<agent>-<slug>.md

  Every agent deposit in this folder's real corpus has carried that form since
  2026-07-10. The gate reads the `from-` prefix and leaves the source name undelimited,
  because a hyphenated source and a hyphenated slug share one separator and the trigger
  needs the prefix alone.

  What is owed, and by whom. The law binds agent-to-agent traffic. Two doors carry their
  own authority and owe nothing, so the README reserves a source word for each and the
  gate honours it ahead of every other read:

    from-owner-<slug>.md          the owner's own wish, which needs no warrant (INV-193)
    stranger-<kind>-<n>-<slug>.md a bridged Issue, whose door is the wish template (INV-146)

  The reserved word is the role. A shipped file names no person, and the language gate
  refuses one (INV-120).

  What an agent's message owes. A message names its birth, and the two births owe different
  things (INV-189). A message blocked by this zone names the work standing still; a message
  carrying a lived fault names the fault and the evidence the sender lived, and nothing of
  that sender's need stand still. A gate demanding blocked work of both would refuse the
  fault message, which is the message a neighbour most wants — the outside view this zone's
  own instruments cannot take. So either field names a birth, and the gate reds a deposit
  naming neither:

    Blocked: <the sender's own work standing until this is answered>   (INV-189, gated)
    Lived: <the fault hit here, and the evidence: what ran, what        (INV-189, gated)
            happened, how it showed>
    Need-by: <a date, or none>                                         (INV-192, reported)
    Id: <a stable identifier this message's reply can name>            (INV-192, reported)

  What a reply owes instead:

    Re: <the identifier of the message this answers>                   (INV-192)

  A reply owes no blocked work of its own: the message it discharges already named the
  blocked work that earned the exchange, and the reply names that message's identifier,
  which is what ties it to the named work (INV-192). So a deposit naming a message is
  read as a reply and passes.

  Need-by and Id are read and reported, and neither moves the exit code. INV-192 gives an
  expired need-by one road: the escalation surfaces in the sender's own status report as
  blocked work aged past its stated need-by, and the human reads that line. A receiver's
  pre-push gate is a different road, so redding a receiver's push for a sender's clock
  would stop work no law asked to stop. This gate's red belongs to INV-189, the law it is
  the arm of. Every field this gate's help names is a field this gate reads.

  A field inside a fenced code block is an example, and the gate reads past every fence
  before it reads any field — the source mark included, so a deposit quoting the agent
  card's block is not made agent traffic by the quote.

Known bounds, stated at their real width:

  1. The trigger is self-declared. A deposit announces itself as agent traffic by its
     filename's source, or by carrying the agent card's `From: <name> (agent)` line. A
     sender who names the file without the prefix and writes no marker is not read here at
     all. The filename is the narrowest available home for the declaration, since naming
     the file is an act the sender performs anyway, and a body field is one a sender simply
     omits — which is how the pre-2026-07-17 gate came to pass every real deposit in this
     folder. It stays a declaration, and a declaration can be withheld.
  2. The reply exemption is self-declared too. The gate reads that a `Re:` line names an
     identifier; no registry ties that identifier to a message this tree sent, so it cannot
     tell a discharged exchange from an invented one.
  3. The sentence's truth is beyond it. The gate reads that a `Blocked:` or a `Lived:` line
     exists and carries words past the placeholder set. Whether the named work stands still,
     and whether the named evidence was lived, is judgment, and it stays with the receiving
     sweep and the prover (INV-150's honest split). "Blocked: my work is blocked" passes
     this gate and fails the sweep's read: a tautology check reads meaning, and its
     false-positive risk outruns its catch.

  All three are the same shape: the gate nets a forgotten field, and the prover reads
  intent. That is the posture every gate here takes.

Usage:
  check-earned-message.py [PATH ...]
    PATH  inbox folders or single files; defaults to ./inbox when present.
Exit 0 when every agent message names one of its two births; exit 1 (with path:line:
findings) when one names neither. Stdlib only.
