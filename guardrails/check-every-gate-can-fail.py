"""check-every-gate-can-fail.py — every push gate carries a known-red proof (SPEC INV-212, gate w).

THE LAW behind it: a gate that cannot red is a check that looks at nothing — it reports green
because it never fires. This movement paid for the lesson: the authority-anchor gate shipped hollow
(commit 8a0209f rebuilt it), reporting green without reaching the surfaces it claimed to inspect,
and a worker's false "zero violations" was the same disease, a claim that protected nothing because
nothing could make it fail. So every gate the push chain runs must carry a KNOWN-RED PROOF: a
committed red-first test that drives that gate's own check to a non-zero exit, so the gate is shown
to fire. A gate with no such proof is itself the finding.

This check enumerates the gate letters guardrails/pre-push invokes — its "-- gate X:" markers, the
same enumeration check-ci-mirror.sh (gate u) reads — and requires each classified in
guardrails/gate-red-proofs.json as one of:

  * a "proof" — a red-first test `<file>::<function>` that drives the gate's check to red, tied to
    that gate by a `reds` token (usually the check's basename) the proof file must reference; or
  * "covered" — a gate that invokes no independent check of its own but rides another gate's red
    (gate c rides the pytest suite, gate b), declared with the reason it carries no separate fixture.

A registered proof is verified by reading its structure, since the suite already runs it under gate b
(exactly as check-ci-mirror.sh's own red-proof runs there): the proof file exists, the named function
is defined in it, the `reds` token appears in the file (tying the proof to this gate's check), and the
function body carries a non-zero-exit assertion, so a bare "the gate ships" presence test cannot pass
as a red proof.

A gate marker classified in none of the three maps reds — the self-widening teeth, so a gate added
later without a proof cannot slip through. A "covered" entry with no reason reds — papering over a
hollow gate is the one thing this gate exists to stop. And a gate that genuinely can never be made to
red by construction is a finding, not a carve-out: the "cannot_red" map exists so such a gate is named
loudly and reds this check, never silently waved through. A registry key naming a letter that is no
local gate is itself drift and reds, like a stale CI carve-out (INV-210).

This is the guard over the guards — a structural scan kin of config-health (INV-175) and the CI-mirror
gate (INV-210).
