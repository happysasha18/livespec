"""check-board.py — the waiting list keeps what waits for his eyes, and nothing on it is ever lost
(SPEC INV-206, ROADMAP 408).

Chat is a display and it scrolls, so a question parked for the person and an answer he never saw both
evaporate. One small file at the host root — the board, `WAITING.md` — holds them, and chat renders it.
An item clears on his acknowledgement alone; it is never auto-expired, because expiring an item he never
read is a silent loss (his 2026-07-17 ~15:57 correction, which caught the pack breaking its own base
rule 10). The bound governs only what is SHOWN: the board shows at most CAP items in front of him, and
when a new item arrives to a full shown set the oldest shown item demotes to the list below — whole and
alive, not deleted. The list itself is unbounded, and so is the attic a cleared or superseded item moves
to with a manifest line (base rule 10).

The board's regions are keyed by machine markers, so a human's section wording is free to change:

  <!-- board:shown -->      the shown set — what his status answer prints in front of him (cap CAP)
  <!-- board:list -->       the rest of the list — alive, opens on request, no cap
  <!-- board:attic -->      cleared or superseded items, each on a manifest line (nothing lost)
  <!-- board:demotions -->  the record that an item moved from the shown set into the list

An item is a line naming its id (`w-<n>`) and its status; an OPEN item is alive. A demotion record names
the id that moved. This gate reds three violations:

  (a) a CLOSING report that omits a still-open item on the board — a report meant to account for what
      waits cannot leave an alive item unnamed (checked only when a report is given);
  (b) a DEMOTION with no matching line — an id recorded as demoted from the shown set that is accounted
      for nowhere on the board (not alive on the list, not on an attic manifest line): the silent loss
      the correction forbids;
  (c) an OVER-CAP shown set — more than CAP items shown at once, when the design demotes the oldest
      instead.

A genuine board passes quiet. Honest boundary: this reads the board's structure, not the meaning of a
free line — a report that names an id while burying it stays the author's own to write straight. It is a
structural scan, kin of check-touchpoint-kind.py and check-cleanup-notice.sh.

Usage:
  check-board.py                              push mode: validate the repo's real WAITING.md (b and c).
  check-board.py --board FILE                 validate one board file (b and c).
  check-board.py --board FILE --report FILE   also check the closing report omits no open item (a).
