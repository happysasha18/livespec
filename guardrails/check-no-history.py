"""check-no-history.py — the no-history / provenance gate (SPEC INV-253).

UNARMED until the spec-format conversion delivery (INV-270); no default file, the document is named on
the command line.

THE LAW (FORMAT.md law 6, INV-253): the spec states today's behaviour only. Dates, provenance, and the
reasons behind past choices live in `JOURNAL.md`, not in the spec. A dated note or a provenance
sentence in the spec BODY is a defect and moves to the journal.

This gate reds the body (the requirements, from the first requirement on — the preamble and glossary
are exempt, as the preamble may state what the codes are and the glossary may define `journal` in
terms of the history it holds) on:

  - a DATE: an ISO date (2026-07-22), a month-name-and-number (July 2026), or a bare four-digit year.
  - a RECORDED-WORD phrase: "his word", "he said", "on his OK", "her word", and their kin — a decision
    attributed to a person's recorded say, which belongs in the journal.
  - a HISTORY phrase: "back in <year>", "as of <year>", "used to be", "formerly", "previously renamed",
    "flipped on", "(v… , <year>)" — a sentence narrating a past state rather than today's.

Deliberately NOT flagged: "supersede(d)", which the attic requirement uses for today's behaviour, and
"history" / "past choices", which the glossary may name when defining the journal. The precise reason
behind a requirement is a cold-reader / journal concern; this gate catches the mechanical date and
attribution markers.

Usage:
  check-no-history.py <document.md>
Exit 0 when the body carries no date or provenance marker (printing the reach line, INV-269); exit 1
naming each. Stdlib only.
