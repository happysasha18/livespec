"""check-size-ratchet.py — the bytes-per-criterion ratchet gate (SPEC INV-264, INV-265).

UNARMED until the spec-format conversion delivery (INV-270). The document is named on the command line;
the recorded bound lives in `guardrails/spec-ratchet.json`.

THE LAW (INV-264). The spec document records a bytes-per-criterion bound — the byte count of its
criterion lines alone (glossary and preamble bytes excluded) divided by the count of criteria in its
body. A delivery may lower the bound or leave it; a delivery whose new bytes-per-criterion is ABOVE the
recorded bound reds. Raising the bound is a change to Requirement 4, run through the pipeline; no
delivery raises it on its own (INV-265). The ratchet governs PRODUCT_SPEC.md alone.

THE UNSEEDED STATE. The initial bound is the value measured at the migration-end freeze, recorded by
the freeze actor (INV-264 criterion 3). Before that freeze the spec is not yet in the requirements
format, so `bytes_per_criterion` is null: the gate reads it as "not yet seeded" and PASSES with the
config's stated reason rather than red-ing on an absent bound. This gate never writes the config —
seeding and lowering the recorded bound are the freeze actor's step, not a side effect of a check.

Usage:
  check-size-ratchet.py <document.md>
  RATCHET_CONFIG overrides the config path (the suite points it at a fixture bound).
Exit 0 when the bound is unseeded, or the new bytes-per-criterion is at or below it (printing the reach
line, INV-269); exit 1 when it is above. Stdlib only.
