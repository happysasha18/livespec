"""check-delta-record.py — the delta classifier (SPEC INV-260, INV-261, INV-262, INV-263).

UNARMED until the spec-format conversion delivery (INV-270). The old document, the new document, and
the delta record are named on the command line.

THE DELTA RECORD FILE FORMAT. A spec-touching delivery carries a delta record — a JSON file kept under
`docs/deltas/` (one per delivery, e.g. `docs/deltas/2026-07-22-row445.json`). Its shape:

    {
      "baseline": "<informational: the freeze the old set came from>",
      "codes": {
        "INV-300": "new",           # a code the body did not carry before
        "INV-4":   "sharpen",       # a code whose criterion text changed
        "INV-99":  "retire",        # a code the body no longer carries
        "INV-5":   "scenario-only"  # a code whose text is unchanged; only its cases/examples moved
      }
    }

Every touched code names exactly one of the four kinds (INV-260). The classifier diffs the old criteria
set against the new one and reds where the record and the diff disagree.

THE DIFF, under normalization (INV-261). Each criterion is keyed by its code and its criterion text;
the text is normalized — whitespace collapsed, italic `*` markers stripped, letters case-folded
OUTSIDE code anchors (specformat.normalize_criterion). A difference that survives normalization is a
text change; any other difference is none. Then:

  - a code in the OLD set and absent from the NEW with no `retire` declared reds (INV-261 c3);
  - a code in the NEW set and absent from the OLD with no `new` declared reds (INV-261 c4);
  - a code whose criterion text differs under normalization with no `sharpen` declared reds (INV-261 c5).

SHARPEN SURVIVAL (INV-262). A `sharpen` code is checked by a normalized full-sentence match: its own
new criterion line must no longer equal its old text (else nothing was sharpened), and its OLD sentence
must not survive that match ANYWHERE in the new document (else the old wording lingers). Either fault
reds.

GROWTH BUDGET (INV-263). Each declared `new` criterion must fit a 500-byte cap (the cap's seed is the
pilot rewrite's measured average bytes per criterion, `prototype/2026-07-22-spec-format/pilot/
NUMBERS.md`). The new-criteria budget is the byte sum of the declared new criteria. The classifier
measures the document's criterion-byte growth over the delivery, EXCLUDING declared-sharpen byte
deltas and glossary-addition bytes (glossary bytes are never criterion bytes, so they fall out by
construction), and reds when the measured growth exceeds the budget.

Usage:
  check-delta-record.py <old.md> <new.md> <record.json>
Exit 0 when the record and the diff agree within budget (printing the reach line, INV-269); exit 1
naming each disagreement. Stdlib only.
