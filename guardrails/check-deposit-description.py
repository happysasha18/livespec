"""check-deposit-description.py — the agent-channel deposit-time description lint (SPEC INV-239, M-422).

BLOCKING. The presence net over the named-reference pair's new reach: the agent channel.

THE LAW behind it (E-35, INV-239). The named-reference pair — a stable code beside its plain
one-sentence description — travels in every cross-agent message, so a neighbour reads a self-explaining
file and never a bare code it cannot decode [INV-183]. This lint reads every `from-<agent>` inbox
deposit and reds a referenced internal code that arrives with no non-empty description beside it,
naming the code and the file. It is homed beside the earned-message gate `check-earned-message.py`,
which already reads those same deposited files, and it reuses that gate's file-discovery so the two
nets read one corpus by one rule [base rule 30, INV-189].

It judges PRESENCE ALONE, never the semantic match: whether the words beside a code truly describe it
is undecidable on a translated or reformulated sentence and belongs to the human net [INV-41, INV-83].
"INV-189 has nothing to do with the price of tea" carries words beside the code and passes this lint;
the human sweep reads whether they describe it.

WHERE IT LIVES. This lint RIDES THE SUITE (gate b) and takes NO push-gate letter, the same placement
check-far-tier.py and check-board.py's own suite test take: its enforcement is a suite test
(tests/test_deposit_description.py) that runs it against the REAL inbox and asserts the expected
result, so a real violation reds the suite and gate b blocks the push. It is NOT wired into the
pre-push chain directly, so the letter-counting meta-guards (INV-210 CI mirror, INV-212
every-gate-can-fail) need not see it — a suite-riding check carries no gate letter, and its known-red
proof is the red-first test the suite runs, not a gate-red-proofs.json entry.

WHAT COUNTS AS A DESCRIPTION (presence). The pair travels in full on a code's FIRST mention, and a
later reference in the same file carries the code alone [INV-28, INV-31]. So the lint reads each
distinct code's FIRST occurrence: on that line, with every code token, bracket, and punctuation
stripped, at least two plain words must stand beside it. A first mention with no words beside it — a
bare `Refs: INV-189, INV-190` line — reds; a later bare mention of an already-described code passes.

Honest bounds, the same shape the earned-message gate states:
  1. The trigger is self-declared. Only a `from-<agent>` deposit (or one carrying the agent card's
     `From: <name> (agent)` mark) is read; the owner's own wish and a bridged stranger Issue owe
     nothing and are skipped, exactly as the earned-message gate skips them.
  2. Presence, not correctness. The lint reads that words stand beside a code, not that they describe
     it. The false-positive risk of a meaning check outruns its catch, so the sweep and the prover
     own the semantic read [INV-150's honest split].

Usage:
  check-deposit-description.py [PATH ...]
    PATH  inbox folders or single files; defaults to ./inbox when present.
Exit 0 when every referenced code in every agent deposit carries a description on its first mention;
exit 1 (with file:code findings) when one stands bare. Stdlib only.
