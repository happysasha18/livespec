"""check-description-field.py — the Formal-index non-empty description-field gate (SPEC INV-239, M-421).

BLOCKING when armed; a self-declared DORMANT no-op until then.

WHERE IT LIVES. This gate RIDES THE SUITE (gate b) and takes NO push-gate letter, the same placement
check-far-tier.py and check-board.py's own suite test take: its enforcement is a suite test
(tests/test_description_field.py) that runs it against the REAL tree and asserts the expected result,
so a real violation reds the suite and gate b blocks the push. It is NOT wired into the pre-push chain
directly, so the letter-counting meta-guards (INV-210 CI mirror, INV-212 every-gate-can-fail) need not
see it — a suite-riding check carries no gate letter, and its known-red proof is the red-first test the
suite runs, not a gate-red-proofs.json entry.

THE LAW behind it (E-35, INV-239). Every reference to an internal item carries a pair — its stable
code beside a plain one-sentence description — and that description's one home is a dedicated field
the Formal index gains, written once there and read by every reference [base rule 4]. This gate is
that field's mechanical net, pinned to a PRESENCE check: it asserts every registered code in the
Formal index carries a non-empty description field and reds a code whose field is empty, naming the
code. It judges presence ALONE — whether the description reads well, or semantically matches the
item, is the human sampling net below [INV-41], never the machine's, because a semantic match on a
translated, reformulated sentence is undecidable and no gate can rule on it [base rule 30].

DORMANT UNTIL ARMED (folded finding N5, INV-217). The existing code set carries no rich descriptions
yet — the back-describe migration that gives every already-registered code its plain-description line
is a future his-gated landing [INV-217]. Until that landing the description field stands empty for the
whole tree, so an armed gate would red everything. The gate therefore ships DORMANT and reads its
arming state from `guardrails/description-field.json`: with `armed: false` it prints an OK-dormant line
and exits 0; the migration flips it to true in the same landing that back-describes the code set, and
only then does the gate enforce. This is the sibling of the index-prose gate's vacuous-pass guard
[INV-218]: a check that would red the whole tree before its subject exists is turned off by name, not
left to false-red.

THE DESCRIPTION FIELD's SHAPE. The field is a dedicated `Description` column the Formal-index table
gains — `| Anchor | One line | Description | Section |`. The terse `One line` map stays the machine
handle's home; the `Description` column is the human-clear one-sentence line the pair law owns. Before
the migration the column is absent, which is exactly why the armed gate would red the whole tree and
why it ships dormant.

Usage:
  check-description-field.py
    Reads guardrails/description-field.json (the arming switch) and PRODUCT_SPEC.md's Formal index.
    DESCRIPTION_FIELD_CONFIG overrides the config path; DESCRIPTION_FIELD_SPEC overrides the spec path
    (the suite points both at fixtures, so the real config is never flipped).
Exit 0 when dormant, or when armed and every registered code carries a non-empty description; exit 1
when armed and a code's field is empty (or the field/section is missing). Stdlib only.
