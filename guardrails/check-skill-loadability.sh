# check-skill-loadability.sh — gate (f) of the push gate: every shipped skill LOADS
# (row 80, the Trail-of-Bits lesson). A skill that ships with broken frontmatter, a
# name that doesn't match its folder, no description, no version, or a "when NOT to
# use" section missing, is RED at push — a skill the harness can't index or a reader
# can't scope is a broken artifact however good its prose.
#
# Usage: check-skill-loadability.sh [skills-dir]
#   skills-dir defaults to "<repo-root>/skills"
