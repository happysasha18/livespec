# check-cleanup-notice.sh — SPEC INV-204 (ROADMAP 417): a cleanup says what it ended. Every cleanup
# path that ENDS a process must emit the notice — WHAT it ended and WHY the run owned it — so an ending
# nobody expected is visible the moment it happens rather than at the next unexplained loss. This gate
# reds a tracked script that ends a process but carries no notice anywhere in its code. It ships ahead
# of INV-162's stricter owned-identity check and makes it safe to land, showing what the strict form
# would have refused before the strict form starts refusing.
#
# Usage: check-cleanup-notice.sh [path]
#   no arg  — scan the repo's tracked executable surfaces (default, the push gate)
#   path    — scan one file or directory (used by the guardrail's own test)
#
# What it flags: a FILE (not a line — an emit and the ending it announces rarely share a line) whose
# comment-stripped code ENDS A PROCESS but carries the cleanup-notice marker NOWHERE in that code. A
# file ENDS a process when its code reaps a process group (`killpg`), name-kills (`pkill` / `killall`),
# or sends a real terminating signal to another process (a shell `kill -<sig>` other than `-0`, or an
# `os.kill(..., signal.SIG...)` / `os.kill(..., <nonzero>)`). A liveness probe (`os.kill(pid, 0)`,
# `kill -0`) and a signal-handler self-raise (`os.kill(os.getpid(), ...)`, whose signal is a variable,
# not a literal) end no spawned resource and never trip the gate. A file that emits the notice —
# carrying the `CLEANUP-NOTICE` marker, or a call to the shared `cleanup_notice` helper — passes.
# Portable across GNU and BSD grep. Honest boundary: this is a structural scan, kin of
# check-muted-launch.sh; an ending built through an indirection the patterns above cannot read stays the
# forker's own to announce. Prose surfaces, this checker, its tests, and the probe corpus are excluded.
