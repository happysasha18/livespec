"""reap_owned_group.py — a worker's teardown reaps its own process group (SPEC INV-230, ROADMAP 393).

INV-213 landed the NOTICE: `guardrails/check-runaway-child.py` finds an owned, orphaned, burning
descendant and REPORTS it, ending nothing — notice-first, so the mechanism can never become the
broad-sweep footgun it guards against. This module lands the remaining two arms of the same class.

ARM 1 — THE REAP. A worker's teardown reaps its OWN process group: a scoped kill of the process group
the RUN itself owns. It is safe because it is the run's own group, exactly INV-162's owned-identity
discipline. The reap takes a NUMERIC process group and refuses any group it cannot prove the run owns —
a program name is not even expressible here, so the broad name-based sweep that once closed the owner's
real browser (base rule 17) cannot be written through this door. The reap targets the group with
`os.killpg`: the run started its children into their own group (a `setsid` / start-new-session at
spawn), so the reaper stands outside that group and the kill reaches the children, not itself. Every
reap reports through the shared cleanup-notice shape (`guardrails/cleanup_notice.py`, row 417,
INV-204), so the reap says what it ended and the proof the run owned it.

ARM 2 — THE IDLE-OUTPUT DETECTION HABIT. A worker whose status reads "running" while its output file
has stopped growing is caught by reading the output's mtime — the liveness-via-mtime read (INV-76). The
memory instance (2026-07-17): a background worker returned its full result and finished ~48 minutes
before anyone noticed, its status line still reading "running", while a `difflib` child burned a full
core on a widget's single-line blob. `find_idle_output_workers` reads mtime alone and returns the
stalled workers with their owned process group, so the caller confirms with `ps` and reaps the owned
group. Detection and reap are two steps, and only an owned group is ever reaped.

SAFETY. This module NEVER reaps a process the run cannot prove it owns: the reap is refused unless the
target process group is in the run's own owned set, and the target is a numeric group, never a name.
