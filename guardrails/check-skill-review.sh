# check-skill-review.sh — gate (s) of the push gate: a push that substantively changes a skill
# reds unless a skill-creator review record for that change is committed (SPEC INV-208, ROADMAP 419).
#
# THE LAW (Alexander 2026-07-17 ~18:26): he leans on the session to remember to run Anthropic's
# skill-creator review whenever a skill is modified, and the session forgets — a reminder does not
# hold. So the habit becomes a machine: when a diff about to be pushed changes a skill's body, the
# push reds until a matching review record exists. This is the same shape as check-prover-record.sh,
# which reds a push whose spec/architecture delta carries no fresh prover record.
#
# Usage: check-skill-review.sh [review-dir]
#   review-dir  defaults to docs/skill-review (relative to the repo root)
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A CHANGED SKILL. The gate reads the push range (the same base ladder as
# check-prover-record.sh: LIVE_SPEC_DIFF_BASE if set — CI passes github.event.before, a planted
# test passes the base commit — else origin/main, else HEAD~1) and looks at every changed file
# under skills/. A skill is SUBSTANTIVELY changed when a changed file under it carries at least one
# added or removed content line that is NOT a version stamp.
#
# THE VERSION-STAMP CARVE-OUT (crucial). scripts/stamp-versions.py rewrites two things in a skill's
# SKILL.md at every version bump: the frontmatter `  version: X.Y.Z` line, and the in-text
# `live-spec-base (vX.Y.Z)` base-reference. That is a machine-stamped copy of one fact (the pack
# version), not a change to the skill's instructions, so it owes NO skill-creator review. A changed
# line is EXEMPT when it is exactly the frontmatter version line, or when it carries the
# base-reference token — so a file whose ONLY changed lines are stamps is not a substantive change.
# A change to the skill's body / instructions / logic leaves a non-stamp changed line, and that is
# what requires the review.
#
# THE RECORD. For each substantively-changed skill <name>, the gate requires a COMMITTED record
# under <review-dir> that (1) names the skill, (2) carries the SKILL-REVIEW marker and a Verdict:
# line, and (3) is FRESH — the newest commit touching <review-dir> is at least as new as the newest
# commit touching that skill (equal, or an ancestor of the record's commit — the record may ship in
# the same commit as the skill change it covers). A stale record from an earlier review does not
# cover a later change, mirroring check-prover-record.sh's freshness rule.
#
# Exit 0 = every substantively-changed skill carries a fresh review record (or none changed).
# Exit 1 = at least one substantively-changed skill has no matching record.
