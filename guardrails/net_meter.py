"""net_meter.py — every net keeps its own liveness numbers (SPEC INV-202, ROADMAP row 391).

A net is a hook or a guard that watches for something. The law: every net records its own two numbers,
how often it RAN and how often it FIRED, and a silent net is read rather than trusted. A net that never
fires is a fact about itself with two readings — the defect is gone and the net is dead weight to retire,
or the net is broken and its trigger sits where the work does not pass. Two numbers tell them apart, and
no net keeps them on its own.

This is the pack-side, every-adopting-host arm of the personal layer's `~/.claude/hooks/hook-meter.py`.
It has two faces, sharing one log:

  net_meter.py --wrap <net-name> <cmd> [args...]   run the net, pass stdin through untouched, re-emit its
                                                   stdout, exit with its own code, and record one JSON
                                                   line of the outcome. A transparent instrument: a
                                                   failure to log is swallowed, since an instrument must
                                                   never break the thing it measures.

  net_meter.py --report [--roster FILE] [--window N]
                                                   read the log against the declared roster of nets and
                                                   give the three readings per net. A roster net with ZERO
                                                   runs reds by name (its trigger sits where work never
                                                   passes). A net with runs at or over the declared window
                                                   and ZERO fires is SURFACED as a retirement candidate
                                                   whose retirement is the human's call — never auto-red,
                                                   never auto-retired. Everything firing reads as live.

The log is one JSON line per invocation, e.g.:

    {"net": "scissors-scan", "event": "Stop", "fired": true, "hits": 2}

Its home is `NET_METER_LOG` (default `.live-spec/net-meter.jsonl`). The roster — the set of nets the host
declares it runs — is what lets a zero-run net be named at all, since a net that never runs writes no line.
The window is the host's declared number of runs a net must reach before its silence reads as retirement.

Kin of ROADMAP row 384 (a check that looked at nothing is not a pass — a net that never ran is that same
check, measured over time rather than over an input set) and INV-41 (the number names its watcher).
