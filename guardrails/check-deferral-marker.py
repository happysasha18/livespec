"""check-deferral-marker.py — the mechanical net for the deferral test (SPEC INV-152).

Rule 29 / INV-152 already require it: writing a needs-the-human's-word marker on a
work item obliges you to NAME the human-only fact behind it — a taste, a policy, or
an act irreversible outside git — and a marker that cannot name its reason defaults
to the seat, the marker itself being the finding. Until now that was discipline only.

This gate is its mechanical arm, the same shape as INV-155's retry-plugin grep: it
reads a resume or decision file as a list of logical WORK ITEMS, finds each item that
parks work for the human, and reds when such an item names no reason category. To
pass, an item either names its reason (one of the four categories below, or a close
natural kin) or drops the marker because the seat can derive the answer and just do it.

A park is recognised by the GRAMMATICAL SHAPE of a deferral rather than a closed list of
phrasings (ROADMAP 417): an open-decision marker (⟨DECIDE⟩, TBD, "to be decided") or a
deferral predicate whose object is the human. So the ⟨DECIDE⟩ marker — the very token
that polices open decisions — is itself caught when it names no human-only fact, instead
of walking straight through the gate policing it.

  Reason categories that satisfy the rule: taste · policy · irreversible · device-feel.

An item is a bullet plus its wrapped continuation lines, folded into one unit before
scanning — because NEXT_STEPS files hard-wrap, a signal and its reason routinely sit on
different physical lines of one bullet. A blank line, a heading, or a new bullet starts
a new item; a fenced code block is skipped whole. A NEGATED mention ("NOT owner-reserved")
and a signal narrated inside quotes are both left alone.

Known bound: two independent parks jammed into one physical bullet, one reasoned and one
not, read as a single item, so the reasoned clause can cover the bare one. Splitting on
every clause boundary would instead FALSE-BLOCK a legitimate wrapped reason (the more
damaging failure, since a spurious red trains a human to bypass the whole commit hook),
so the item is the unit and this narrow case is accepted.

Usage:
  check-deferral-marker.py [FILE ...]
    FILE  files to scan; defaults to ./NEXT_STEPS.md and ./docs/decisions/*.md when present.
Exit 0 when every parked item names its reason; exit 1 (with path:line: findings)
when one does not. Stdlib only.

# The GRAMMATICAL SHAPE of a deferral, read rather than a closed literal list (ROADMAP 417). A parked
# item takes one of two grammatical forms, and either is a deferral whatever its exact words:
#
#   (1) an OPEN-DECISION MARKER — a bracketed decide/decision token (⟨DECIDE⟩, <DECISION>, [DECIDE]) or
#       a to-be-decided phrase (TBD, "to be decided", "decision pending", "open decision"). This is the
#       form the old literal list was blind to, so ⟨DECIDE⟩ — the very marker that polices deferrals —
#       used to walk straight through the gate policing it.
#   (2) a DEFERRAL PREDICATE whose object is the human — a verb of holding/handing (hold, reserve,
#       defer, await, wait, leave) pointed at him (for/to/on his ...), or the possessive "his to
#       <verb>" / "still his". A version-bump park ("row N reserved") is one instance of (2).
#
# Kept narrow at the edges on purpose: a blocking gate must not fire on narration that merely quotes
# "his word" while describing a decision already made, so bare "his word" is NOT a marker — a genuine
# park says more. The pack's resume and decision files are written in English (docs language), which the
# gate scans; a human-language marker in chat is caught by the hook's delivery arm instead.
