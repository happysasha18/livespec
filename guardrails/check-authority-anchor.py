"""check-authority-anchor.py — the machine that holds the writing rule on HUMAN AUTHORITY
(SPEC INV-207, ROADMAP row 415).

THE LAW it enforces. Every claim in this pack stands on an artifact a reader can go and check. A
human's word is the one input with no artifact behind it, and therefore the one claim no agent,
prover, or gate questions. So a sentence that records a decision, word, or ruling AS the person's must
name the EXCHANGE it came from — at minimum a date a reader can go to and check. A sentence the pack
reasoned out for itself is written in the pack's own voice; it claims no human authority, is
challengeable by every reader, and is not this gate's business. An autonomy grant authorizes an agent
to DECIDE; it never authorizes recording that decision AS the human's.

WHAT THE GATE CAN AND CANNOT DO — read this before trusting it. The gate is a CHEAP FIRST PASS; the read-back below is the
defence. It catches an attribution that carries NO checkable anchor at all. It CANNOT catch a
fabrication that carries a plausible date: a session that invents a ranking invents the date under it
just as easily, and a date only has to PARSE for the anchor rule to pass it. The real defence against a
dated fabrication is the READ-BACK: `DECISIONS.md` shows the person the decisions the pack believes he
made, on his own clock, and he strikes what he never said — which is exactly how the founding incident
was caught (he read the resume file and recognised nothing). This gate exists to keep an unanchored
attribution from ever reaching that surface unnoticed, and to reach the churny surfaces where an
attribution first gets written. It does not stand in for the read-back.

THE THREE ACTS the gate serves:

  * The DECISION-SET RECORD (the enforced, push-wired HARD block). A file that declares itself a
    decision record with a `DECISION-RECORD` marker line (the touchpoint-kind gate's self-declaration
    shape) holds, by construction, nothing but decisions recorded as the person's. Every live on-record
    entry there must carry its exchange anchor (a real calendar date); a struck entry — a genuine
    ~~strikethrough~~ retraction, or an entry sitting in a `<!-- record:struck -->` region — is skipped,
    since the person has already reached in and struck it. A bullet, a wrapped multi-line entry, or a
    prose paragraph carrying an authority-claim all count as entries here. This surface is free of the
    rule-language noise below, so the anchor rule is unambiguous and false-positive-free — which is why
    it, and it alone, is the standing gate's HARD block.
  * The RISKY-SURFACE FIRST PASS (push-wired, ADVISORY). The founding fabrication was NOT written on a
    decision record — it was written in the resume file and travelled from there into a plan and a chat
    claim. So the standing scan also REACHES the churny surfaces where an attribution first gets
    written (the resume file, the active roadmap). There it cannot be a hard block: those surfaces are
    thick with the pack's own RULE language ("his word settles it", "blocked on his word") and with
    NARRATION of past incidents, both of which name the person's authority without a date and rightly
    need none. A deterministic gate cannot tell live narration from a live fabrication — only meaning
    can — so this pass REPORTS its candidates for the read-back and the human sweep to triage, and does
    NOT fail the push. A tight detector (rule-frame and copula forms exempted, a same-day time counted
    as an anchor) keeps the report from drowning in rule-language. The class itself is held by the
    judge, below.
  * The FIRST-SWEEP act (arg mode) and the JUDGE (--judge). Given files as arguments, the gate reports
    every authority-claim SENTENCE that names no date, for a one-time human sweep of the spec, the base
    rulebook, and the roadmap — WIDE recall, the triage list's job. The `--judge` mode hands the risky
    surfaces to the register judge (hooks/register_judge_core.py), which reads MEANING and separates a
    specific decision recorded as the person's from abstract rule language — the pack's own head-rule
    answer to a class a literal gate cannot hold. The judge is a sweep tool rather than a blocking push gate:
    a push-blocking model call would red on its own breakage and train the guarded to route around it,
    which is why the pack keeps its judges advisory everywhere.

An authority-claim is (patterns in authority-anchor.json, so this code names no person):
  * a possessive authority-noun with a DEFINITE possessor — "his word", "the owner's ruling", "her
    call", a named person's ranking (prepositional forms like "on his OK" / "per his word" are this case);
  * a verb of authority with a DEFINITE personal subject — "he decided", "the owner ordered", a named
    person chose.
The abstract-role possessors ("the human's", "the person's", "the reader's", "a human", "one") are
NOT authority-claims: they are the pack stating a rule in its own voice. The person names are a
per-host roster (data); the definite role forms ("his", "the owner's", "he decided") are
person-agnostic, so the law is stated for ANY person and ANY host.

THE ANCHOR. A claim passes when its sentence carries a REAL calendar date token (YYYY-MM-DD that names
an existing day — 2026-13-45 does not parse and does not satisfy the anchor). A bare time (~15:37)
alone is not enough on a decision record — the exchange's WHEN is a day; on the risky-surface first
pass, where the day is fixed by the file's own dated context, a same-day time counts as a pointer a
reader can follow. The profile's own style is the target shape: "<person> 2026-07-03, standing" /
"<person> 2026-07-14, on the passivity finding: ...". The person names live in the config data, never in
this code, so the detector names no person.

Usage:
  check-authority-anchor.py                 push mode: HARD-block scan of every DECISION-RECORD
                                            surface, plus an ADVISORY report over the risky
                                            attribution surfaces (resume file, roadmap).
  check-authority-anchor.py [--config F] FILE ...
                                            sweep/fixture mode: report each file's unanchored
                                            authority claims (a DECISION-RECORD file uses the strict
                                            per-entry rule; free prose uses the wide sentence rule).
  check-authority-anchor.py --judge FILE ... hand the files to the register judge (the class-holder),
                                            which separates a recorded decision from rule language.
Exit 0 = no unanchored authority-claim on an ENFORCED surface. Exit 1 = at least one.
