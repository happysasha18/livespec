# check-broad-kill.sh — SPEC INV-162 (ROADMAP 334, inverted 417): a cleanup ends only what THIS RUN
# provably owns, identified by a recorded PID, a shell variable holding one, or the process group the
# run itself holds. When several sessions share one machine, a kill by a shared install path reaches the
# other sessions' live browsers too, so the recorded process group is the sole safe target there (the
# owner's 2026-07-17 correction on ROADMAP 335). A guard that recognised a cleanup by a process NAME
# could never tell this run's
# copy of a program from the person's copy — that is the defect that once closed the owner's REAL
# browser mid-session (a broad `pkill chrome` / `pkill chrome_crashpad_handler`), destroying work state
# outside git, the effect base rule 17 forbids. So this gate DENIES every ending that names a NAME, and
# accepts an ending that proves what it owns. The four browser words that used to BE the check are now
# only this comment's example — the check itself never asks which programs matter, it asks whether the
# command can prove what it is ending.
#
# Usage: check-broad-kill.sh [path]
#   no arg  — scan the repo's tracked executable surfaces (default, the push gate)
#   path    — scan one file or directory (used by the guardrail's own test)
#
# What it flags: a line whose comment-stripped code ENDS a process by NAME —
#   * `pkill` or `killall`, which target a process by name/pattern by construction, including a
#     full-path invocation like `/usr/bin/pkill chrome`; or
#   * `kill` fed by a name-to-pid resolver — `pgrep` / `pidof`, or a `ps ... | grep <name>` pipeline —
#     the same danger wearing kill's clothes (`kill $(pgrep chrome)`, `pgrep chrome | xargs kill`,
#     `ps aux | grep chrome | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill`); or
#   * a two-line form of that: a variable assigned from a resolver (`PIDS=$(pgrep -f chrome)`) and then
#     fed to `kill` on a later line — the taint is tracked across the file so the split cannot hide it.
# An ending that PROVES what it owns passes quiet: `kill $pid` / `kill 48213` / `os.killpg($pgid,...)`
# name a PID or a process group directly and are never name-based. The safe targets per SPEC INV-162
# are a recorded PID, a shell variable holding one passed to `kill`, or a process group the run owns
# (`os.killpg`). A kill by an INSTALL PATH is NOT exempt: a shared install such as `~/.cache/puppeteer`
# reaches every session that drives its browser from that path (the owner's 2026-07-17 correction on
# ROADMAP 335), so the recorded process group is the sole target that always stays inside this run, and
# a `pkill -f user-data-dir` reaches every process carrying that flag. This says nothing about which
# programs matter — Safari, Slack, node, and chrome all red the same when ended by name, because none of
# them proves ownership. Portable across GNU and BSD grep. Prose surfaces (spec, ROADMAP, inbox, this
# checker, its own tests, the probe corpus) legitimately NAME the patterns to forbid or exercise them
# and are excluded from the repo scan.
