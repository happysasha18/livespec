"""check-runaway-child.py — a finished worker leaves no runaway child that burns unseen (SPEC INV-213).

THE LAW. When a worker or task the run spawned COMPLETES, a descendant it left behind can keep
burning a full core unnoticed. The memory instance (2026-07-17): a difflib process burned one core
for forty-six minutes after its worker reported done, and a frozen status line masked it until the
next unexplained slowdown. The run owns that descendant — it sits in the run's own process group, or
it runs from under the run's own temp tree — so the run answers for it. At a stopping point the run
REPORTS a runaway descendant it provably owns: what it is, how much CPU it holds, and why the run
owns it. That is the minimum owed (the owner 2026-07-17 ~16:58, the same word that ordered row 417's
cleanup notice), so an unexpected burn is visible the moment it happens.

WHERE IT LIVES. This is a Stop-time notice, not a push gate: a push gate runs long after the runaway
would have burned its cores, so it takes no pre-push letter and stands beside the Stop-surface judges.

THE SAFETY DISCIPLINE (SPEC INV-162). This runs in process space, where a coarse scope does real
harm — a broad name-based sweep once closed the owner's real browser (base rule 17). So a runaway is
identified ONLY by PROVABLE OWNERSHIP, never by a program name:
  * a process in the run's OWN process group (a pgid the run holds), or
  * a process running from UNDER the run's own temp tree (a path the run owns).
`find_runaways` reads NO command/name field for its verdict. A process whose command merely matches a
known burner, but sits in a foreign process group and under no owned tree, is never targeted — the run
cannot prove it owns it, so a name match alone must not fire.

WHAT COUNTS AS A RUNAWAY. All four hold:
  * OWNED — proved by process group or owned tree, above;
  * ORPHANED — its owning parent is no longer alive (reparented to init, or a ppid absent from the
    live table): a live-and-working child whose parent is alive is NOT a runaway;
  * BURNING — its CPU share is at or above the threshold (default 50%);
  * NOT self — the notice mechanism and the group lead never report themselves.

NOTICE-FIRST. It REPORTS through the shared cleanup-notice module (`guardrails/cleanup_notice.py`,
row 417) and ends NO process. A reap gated on the same strict ownership proof is a later, optional
step; the first version reports, so the mechanism can never itself become the broad-sweep footgun it
guards against. As a Stop-time notice it always exits zero and never blocks a stop.

LIVE WIRING is a documented, owner-run install step, not an auto-wire into the running session's
Stop hook: wiring a process scanner into a live session mid-movement could report against that
session's own live background workers. The owner installs it when a session is quiet (guardrails/README.md).
