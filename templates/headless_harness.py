"""The live-spec pack's CANONICAL headless-Chrome test harness, shipped ONCE as a template.

This is the one home of the browser test harness [SPEC INV-158]: a zero-dependency, standard-library
driver for a real headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol (CDP) — no selenium, no playwright, no
pip. It exists so a project's browser-level interaction facts can be asserted in a REAL browser, the
way a visitor meets them, rather than string-matched in source.

Three run-hygiene properties are baked in [SPEC INV-157]:

  * it launches Chrome MUTED — the launch carries ``--mute-audio``, so a test run makes no sound on
    the machine it runs on, silencing the browser at its source and leaving system volume alone;
  * on teardown it REAPS THE WHOLE PROCESS GROUP of the Chrome it launched (helper, renderer, gpu
    children included) with a ``killpg`` SIGKILL, so a run leaves no orphan alive to accumulate
    across runs and saturate the machine (``start_new_session=True`` puts Chrome in its own group).
    Teardown runs on the CATCHABLE exits too: ``close()`` is registered on ``atexit`` and on
    ``SIGINT``/``SIGTERM`` (``_install_teardown_hooks``), so Ctrl-C and most kills still reap. For the
    UNCATCHABLE ones (``SIGKILL``, power loss, machine sleep mid-run) — which never run teardown — a
    LAUNCH-TIME SWEEP (``_sweep_stale_profiles``) is the backstop: each launch records its Chrome pid
    AND a boot identifier in its throwaway profile dir and, before opening its own, reaps any prior
    profile dir under the system temp. A dir from the CURRENT boot whose recorded owner is dead has
    its lingering process group killed, then its dir removed; a dir from a PRIOR boot needs no kill —
    a reboot already killed every process, and its recorded pid could even be reused by an unrelated
    live group, so it is only removed, never signalled. So a killed run's orphans are cleaned on the
    NEXT launch. The sweep never touches a concurrent live run — a dir whose recorded pid is still
    alive (same boot) is skipped, and a dir with no recorded owner yet is skipped, so a sibling is safe;
  * it bounds each command it sends the browser with a real PER-COMMAND DEADLINE (``CMD_TIMEOUT`` set
    on ``self._deadline``, over a blocking socket left at ``settimeout(None)``), so a slow machine
    waits patiently while a genuine hang still fails with a clear bounded error — never a blanket I/O
    timeout that fires under load and reads a slow machine as a failed test.

A consuming project adopts this harness by UPDATING THE PACK — the catch-up walk that brings a package
update onto a host — never by writing a private copy, so a fix to the core (launch flags, teardown,
deadline) lands once and reaches every consumer. A project layers its own project-specific driving
methods on top by SUBCLASSING ``Browser`` and passing ``serve(...)`` hooks. What a project layers on,
by example: EX-LOAD network shaping (``block``/network-log capture over ``Network.setBlockedURLs`` and
the ``requestWillBeSent`` drain, plus a ``serve(hold=...)`` slow-response seam); EX-GREET storage and
language/clock overrides (localStorage helpers, a pre-load ``navigator.language``/``Date#getHours``
override); EX-SHARE clipboard payload capture (pre-loading a stub over ``navigator.clipboard.writeText``
via ``inject``). None of those ship in this core — it stays generic so it cannot drift into divergent
copies. This is the pack's one-home law applied to test infrastructure [SPEC INV-158].

This module is a TEMPLATE: it is importable (no syntax errors) but is not run by live-spec's own suite.

Two pieces:
  * a tiny http server thread rooted at a project's baked site dir, so ``/``, sub-paths and
    ``fetch()`` of baked JSON all resolve over http (file:// would block the fetch);
  * a minimal CDP client over a raw-socket WebSocket: navigate, evaluate JS, dispatch NATIVE mouse
    events (so :hover and hit-testing are the browser's, not synthetic), read the DOM, set the viewport.

Chrome is located at the standard macOS path. If it is absent the harness raises ``ChromeMissing`` —
the caller turns that into an EXPECTED, pinned skip (never a silent pass).

Usage:

    from headless_harness import serve, Browser, ChromeMissing
    with serve(site_dir) as base, Browser() as br:
        br.navigate(base + "/")
        n = br.evaluate("document.querySelectorAll('figure').length")
