# Adopting the pack in an existing project

live-spec attaches to a codebase that already has code, documents, and habits. The project that
adopts it is called the **host**. The normative procedure is [adopt/ADOPT.md](../adopt/ADOPT.md);
this page gives the shape of the run, what the host gains, and where the supporting files live.
When this page and ADOPT.md differ, ADOPT.md wins.

One boundary holds through the whole run: from a host session, the live-spec package repo is
read-only. A defect found during adoption goes into live-spec's `inbox/` as one new file and into
the host's own journal (SPEC INV-10).

## The procedure at a glance

ADOPT.md runs as ordered phases; each phase states its own done-condition. In plain terms:

1. **Version control first (Phase 0).** The host becomes a git repo with a `.gitignore`, one
   baseline commit of the pristine tree, and a recorded decision about a remote. From this point
   the whole run is reversible.
2. **Cruft sweep, offered once (Phase 0.5).** Writing the `.gitignore` surfaces regenerable junk
   such as caches and stale exports. The run lists it in groups and deletes only what the human
   approves.
3. **Orient (Phase 1).** The run loads the human's personal profile, asks the founding questions
   (personal or reusable, what kind of project this is, budget pressure), proposes matching
   skills, and reads every existing document before writing anything. The result is a per-document
   digest under `.live-spec/adopt/`, the run's audit trail.
4. **Inventory (Phase 2).** Every user-facing output, surface, and data entity gets one line with
   a real `file:line` pin. The surfaces seed the surface registry.
5. **Re-engineer existing documents (Phase 3).** What exists turns into the canonical document
   set, keeping the original claims and marking their provenance. Each live surface that lacks
   spec backing gets a human verdict: promote, quarantine, or attic.
6. **Attic over deletion (Phase 4).** Superseded files move to `attic/` with a manifest line,
   via `git mv`, after the human approves the set. Adoption never deletes a host file (INV-7).
7. **Architecture, then tests (Phase 5).** `ARCHITECTURE.md` grows from the inventory's pins;
   `TEST_MATRIX.md` is derived through it, one row per fact under its owning node, each row with
   a test level.
8. **Attach record (Phase 6).** The run records the installed skill versions in `.live-spec/`,
   seeds the host profile, writes its journal entry, and the host joins the standard pipeline.

The recommended first action after adoption is a full product-prover pass over the spec; ADOPT.md
Phase 6 states the one condition that lets a host skip it.

## What the host gains

- **A living spec** — `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, use-case-first, with entities, states, transitions,
  invariants, and cross-section composition underneath.
- **An architecture doc and a test matrix** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` names the nodes and seams;
  `TEST_MATRIX.md` derives one pinned-level row per spec fact through them.
- **A journal** — `JOURNAL.md`, dated entries with the why, so history survives memory wipes.
- **A resume file** — `NEXT_STEPS.md`, the one place a cold session reads to continue the work.
- **A queue** — `ROADMAP.md`, where existing TODO items land as rows.
- **A surface registry** — `SURFACE_REGISTRY.md` (or an equivalent gate test), so an unregistered
  rendered surface goes red.
- **Profiles** — the host profile at `.live-spec/profile.md` holds this project's overrides; the
  personal profile at `~/.claude/live-spec/profile.md` holds the human's standing preferences.
  The host file narrows the personal one per the settings ladder (SPEC E-13).

## Migrating an existing codebase

Phase 3 of ADOPT.md owns the mapping of existing documents: an existing spec becomes
`PRODUCT_SPEC.md` sections, existing tests become matrix rows cited at their real level, and an
existing roadmap becomes queue rows. Every re-engineered claim starts unverified and gets
reconciled against real code at the first landing that touches its surface. A host whose docs are
already in live-spec shape keeps them as they are; adoption then only fills what is missing,
usually the surface registry and the matrix.

The mapping is type-aware. The project kind recorded at orient (book, backend service, static
site, fullstack app, CLI, skill pack) sets the spec's primary unit: a feature for an app, a
command or endpoint for a CLI or API, a chapter for a book, a promised guarantee for a
methodology package. The decided format lives in
[docs/spec-format-by-project-type.md](spec-format-by-project-type.md).

[MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md) covers already-adopted hosts catching up with pack changes. It
currently records two: the package rename (livespec to live-spec, including the `.live-spec/`
folder and the skill names), and the matrix reshape, where an old flat matrix regroups its
existing rows under architecture nodes at the host's first architecture landing. Each host's own
session executes these steps at its next update; nothing outside a host's session writes that
host's repo.

## The scaffold and templates

`templates/` holds one starter file per canonical document: `PRODUCT_SPEC.template.md`,
`ARCHITECTURE.template.md`, `TEST_MATRIX.template.md`, `ROADMAP.template.md`,
`JOURNAL.template.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.template.md`, `PROBLEMS.template.md`, `KILL_LIST.template.md`,
`profile.template.md`, and `test_scaffold.template.py`. A fresh project copies them at bootstrap;
an adopted host uses them only for the documents it lacks, since Phase 3 re-engineers the rest.
The test scaffold lands in `tests/` and defines the minimal green for the first landing.

`scaffold/guardrails/README.md` is the authoritative description of the four mechanical checks a
host instantiates for its own surfaces: completeness (every rendered surface is registered and
non-empty), tests-present (a diff touching a user-facing module also touches `tests/`),
behaviour-traces-to-spec (every user-facing behaviour names its spec clause), and conflicts
(duplicate IDs, dead references, unmatrixed invariants). Runnable generic check code is a planned
next movement; today each project wires its own instance. `install.sh` at the package root copies
the pack's skills into `~/.claude/skills/`, backing up any existing skill with a timestamp.

## What stays optional

- **The remote.** A GitHub remote either exists by the first landing or the human explicitly
  declines one; both outcomes are recorded.
- **The cruft sweep.** The run may skip offering it; deletion without an approval is the only
  forbidden path.
- **The personal profile.** The human may decline creating one; the session then runs on package
  defaults, said aloud.
- **Hooks.** Offered in plain words at attach, on the same terms as at bootstrap; never imposed.
- **The post-adoption prover pass.** Recommended, and skippable when a recent prover record from
  the same prover version covers the spec with no drift since.
