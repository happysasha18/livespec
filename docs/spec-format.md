# The spec format — definition

This page defines the requirements genre the spec is written in. A section that follows this page can be read by a stranger on first pass.

## Document structure

A spec document opens with a short preamble: what the document covers, what the bracket codes are, and how the keywords read. A glossary follows. The body is a list of requirements.

Each requirement has three parts, in this order:

1. **Context** — two to four short sentences: when the situation arises, who is involved, what the reader sees.
2. **User Story** — one sentence: as a person in a named position, I want one thing, so that one stated benefit follows.
3. **Acceptance Criteria** — the behaviour, grouped into named cases. A case is one bold line naming a situation, followed by two to six numbered criteria. Every criterion sits in exactly one case, and the numbering runs continuously through the requirement.

## The criterion form

One criterion carries one trigger and one response. The keywords *when*, *while*, *if*, *then*, and *shall* are set in lowercase italics; no word in the document is written in all capitals. The code anchor — `[INV-x]`, `[T-x]`, `[E-x]`, `[M-x]` — trails at the line's end and points to the rule's home in the project spec. A reader can ignore the anchors; a maintainer follows them.

## The laws

1. **Closed vocabulary.** Every domain noun used anywhere in the document has a one-sentence definition in the glossary. A word of ordinary English needs no entry. A coined word is translated to a defined standard term before it enters the document.
2. **One name per thing.** One artifact carries one name everywhere. An artifact referenced twice under two names is a defect.
3. **Context before criteria.** A reader meets the situation and the people in it before the first rule. A term is introduced before its rules use it.
4. **Every judgment names its judge and its inputs.** An evaluative phrase in a criterion — broken, larger than, worth — says who judges and by what. Where the source spec never answers, the criterion names the plainest honest actor and carries a `[GAP: ...]` line under it. Inventing behaviour is forbidden; a gap line is the correct output for a real hole.
5. **Every relational word fills its slots.** Words like proportional, larger, sufficient, appropriate, fast, easily, worth, and adjusted open empty slots: proportional — to what; larger — than what; sufficient — for what. A sentence fills every slot its words open, right where the word stands — the reference point, the measure, or the reason. A slot that cannot be filled gets the alternatives named or a `[GAP]` line. An unfilled slot is a blocking finding.
6. **No history in the spec.** The spec states today's behaviour. Dates, provenance, and the reasons behind past choices live in the journal.

## The comprehension gate

A changed section passes two layers before it ships.

**Mechanical lints first**, each a free script run before any reader:

- the vocabulary check — every domain noun in the text has its glossary entry;
- the one-name check — no artifact appears under two names;
- the style lint — sentence length, no all-capital words outside code anchors, no contrast-by-denial frames, no grading adjectives;
- the weak-word check — a list of slot-opening words, seeded from the ISO 29148 and INCOSE vague-term lists (appropriate, sufficient, adequate, fast, easily, efficient, flexible, as required, if necessary, proportional, reasonable, robust, seamless, timely, user-friendly, minimal, maximal, several, some) plus the project's own additions; a hit without its reference point nearby is red.

**Then a panel of fresh cold readers**, applied per changed section, until two consecutive reads return zero blocking findings. Each reader reads without project context. At every relational word the reader asks: relative to what? by what measure? else what alternatives? — catching the words the list does not know yet, and each new catch joins the list. The measured pattern behind this gate: every fresh reader finds new blocking terms, fixed items stay fixed, and the finding stream thins toward zero only under consecutive clean reads. Per changed section the gate is cheap: a small delta puts one glossary entry and a handful of criteria in front of a reader, not the whole document.
