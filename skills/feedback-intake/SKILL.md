name: feedback-intake
description: Receive anything a person hands back to the project — a remark, an answer, a screenshot, a reaction, a dropped file — and route it to the home its law owns; nothing handed in is ever lost. Use whenever feedback arrives in any form (a comment on shown work, an answered decision page, a file appearing in inbox/, a user's report relayed by the human), when sweeping the inbox, when opening or appending the feedback ledger (FEEDBACK.md), or when deciding where a handed-in item belongs. It is the intake half of the exchange — communicator carries work out to the human, this skill carries what comes back. NOT for the agent's own outputs or questions; it never opens a queue row on its own judgment (the wish door owns that verdict); and it is no analytics machine — reading, scoring, and aggregating the collected signals stay with the measurement family.

A person looks at what shipped and something occurs to them — a reaction, an answer, a screenshot with
a red circle, a log file. **Feedback** is anything a person hands back to the project: any size, any
moment, any channel (SPEC E-28). The person is usually the project's human; when the project's product
has users of its own, their reports travel the same road once a session receives them. This skill owns
what happens next: every received item lands, the same session, in the home its route owns — and the
person hears where it went.

## When it fires

The moment any session receives a handed-in item, and at every inbox sweep for files that carry
feedback rather than a wish. It fires in ANY session — an unassigned session cannot write the host's
files, so its intake move is the inbox door: one new file, committed, swept later by the host's own
session.

## When NOT to fire

Never on the agent's own output or on a question the agent asked. Never on something the human merely
mentions without handing it in — unsure whether a remark was handed in is answered by one plain
question. And it never opens a queue row on its own judgment: the wish door owns that verdict (SPEC
T-12); this skill only recognizes that an item is wish-shaped and walks it to wish intake.

## The three channels (SPEC T-20)

- **Spoken or typed** — a remark in the conversation, or a note in a file the person points at.
- **A comment on something shown** — decision pages and review pages already capture answers as saved
  JSON (SPEC INV-4, INV-64); each saved answer is a feedback item whose home the capture law already
  names (the archive and its harvested row).
- **A dropped file** — a screenshot, a log, a document: handed over in the conversation, or arriving
  from any outside session through the host's inbox door (one NEW file per item, the wish files' own
  naming and collision law, SPEC E-11). A file arriving with no words gets one plain question about
  what it means; a guess is never written into the ledger.

## The routing table — every item takes exactly one route, every route has a home

| What arrived | Route | Home |
|---|---|---|
| an item asking for new behaviour | it is a WISH — walk wish intake: door, echo, row (SPEC T-12) | its queue row |
| a fix-sized comment on shown work | FIXED the same session; a story-sized comment queues as a wish | the fixing commit + its journal line |
| an answer to an open question | CLOSES it forever, harvested the same session (SPEC INV-59) | the decision archive + the harvested row |
| a reaction to a shipped feature | FIELD EVIDENCE — the line cites the feature's scenario; the feature's success measure (SPEC INV-21) gains real signals | a dated feedback-ledger line |
| workshop noise (a flaky tool, a missing dependency) | the problem ledger's law (SPEC INV-23) | `.live-spec/PROBLEMS.md` |

The seam between the two ledgers is the SUBJECT: the product's behaviour goes to FEEDBACK.md, the
workshop's goes to PROBLEMS.md, one home each. Field evidence grows into a wish only by the human's
word or a tripwire verdict.

## The feedback ledger (FEEDBACK.md)

The routes above that had no home before this skill — field evidence, plain reactions, wordless drops
awaiting their question — get one: **FEEDBACK.md**, an append-only file beside the queue at the host
root. One dated line per item: when it arrived · who handed it in and through which channel · what it
concerns on the feature map · the item in plain words · where it went. The ledger is born on its first
line, with a two-line header naming this law; a ledger holding only its header is healthy. It archives
like the queue and is never trimmed (SPEC INV-1). Only the assigned session writes it — outsiders use
the inbox door (SPEC INV-10), and appends take the pen like any shared-doc edit (SPEC T-18).

## The receipt discipline (SPEC INV-68)

- Every arrival is echoed back in one sentence — **one echo per item**: a wish-shaped item's echo IS
  the wish echo (SPEC INV-27); everything else hears what was heard and where it went.
- A re-mention of an already-recorded item **appends its date** to the existing line and changes
  nothing else — the problem ledger's own discipline, applied here.
- The ledger line is written the same session the item arrives; at an inbox sweep, ONE commit both
  lands the route (the row, the ledger line) and removes the swept file (SPEC T-10).
- Dates come from the clock, read at the moment of writing, never invented (SPEC INV-24).

## What this skill deliberately leaves alone

No end-user feedback widget on a host's own product — a site's visitors writing in rides the
measurement family (its own queue row) or arrives relayed. No automatic reading, scoring, or
aggregation of the ledger — the reading machinery stays a named target of the measurement family.
No new door mechanics — the inbox is reused exactly as it stands.
