description: The pack's outbound feedback arm. On a genuinely strong, RARE reaction from the user — a real delight, a real hurt, a comparably notable moment — OFFER, asking positive consent every time, to draft a short private "upstream note" to the pack's authors about what happened. Use when the conversation shows an unmistakable strong reaction and the host has turned `feedback-upstream: on`; it drafts a distilled, non-public note into `outbox/` and never sends it, delivery being the human's own step. NOT feedback-intake — that RECEIVES what a person hands in, this NOTICES a strong moment and offers to carry a note up. NOT a measurement machine — it reads one moment, never scores or aggregates. Off by default, silent unless a host opts in.

# feedback-collector — an occasional note home to the authors

The pack has three arrows. communicator carries work OUT to the human. feedback-intake carries what a
person hands BACK. This skill carries an occasional note UP — to the people who wrote the pack — so they
learn what delighted or hurt real use. It is the outbound feedback arm, and it moves rarely and only with
the human's explicit word. Spec home: `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` E-30 / T-21 / INV-161.

## Before anything: the flag

The arm is **off by default**. It reads nothing, offers nothing, and stays wholly silent unless the host
has turned it on with a recorded profile line:

```
- `feedback-upstream: on`   # this host sends occasional notes up to the pack's authors (dated)
```

A host that adopted the pack switches it on to send notes up. The authors' own origin machine leaves it
off — it has no upstream above it. Off means off: no reading for a strong moment, no offer, no note. Read
the flag first, every time (settings ladder, `live-spec-base` E-13).

## When it fires

With the flag on, the arm fires on **one genuinely strong, unmistakable reaction** — a real delight, a
real hurt, a comparably notable moment. It fires at the tempo of the lead's own occasional surfacing: rare
by design, on a clear signal, and silent on a mild or routine reaction. The reading of "strong" is a
conservative floor here — take only the unmistakable, and when in doubt, stay silent. (The finer reading
of the signal is its own later design pass; this v1 leans hard toward silence.)

## When NOT to fire

It stays silent — no offer, no note — on:

- any reaction below the unmistakable bar (mild, routine, ambiguous — the default, and the common case);
- the agent's own output or a question the agent asked;
- a host that has not turned the flag on;
- a moment the human hands in as ordinary feedback (that is feedback-intake's, not this arm's).

The one moment the human HANDS the reaction in (a comment on shown work), feedback-intake logs its
field-evidence ledger line and this arm, if the moment reads as strong, offers the upstream note — the two
do disjoint work, they do not compete (`PRODUCT_SPEC.md` E-30, T-20 route 4).

## The offer — positive consent, every time

On a qualifying moment, OFFER in one short line, in the conversation's own language, and ask for a positive
yes. Example (English; mirror the chat's language):

> That landed as a strong moment. Want me to draft a short note to the pack's authors about what happened
> here — what worked or what hurt? Nothing leaves without your explicit yes; it drafts privately to your
> `outbox/`, nothing public.

Consent here is **positive word, asked every time** — the deliberate opposite of the pack's
silence-is-consent default (`INV-31`), because this is an outbound move about a real person. A silence, a
shrug, or an unclear answer leaves the note **unwritten**. Only an explicit yes writes it.

## The upstream note — distilled, non-public, deposited

On the yes, write **one upstream note** and deposit it. The note is:

- **distilled** — the point of what happened, not the raw material; never the transcript, never a script,
  never the user's private content past what the point needs;
- **self-contained** — it carries its own context, so a reader upstream who does not know this user
  understands it on its own;
- **a courteous private request** — shaped for the authors, never for a public audience.

Example note (the shape to follow):

```
# Upstream note — 2026-07-15

What happened. A user shipping a batch of queue items hit real delight when the
pipeline's standing net caught a stray citation their hand-edit had missed — the
automated guard paid off visibly, in front of them.

What it tells the authors. The forward-binding net earns its keep on first
contact; the "net catches what the hand misses" moment is worth keeping as the
pack grows.

Context for a reader who wasn't here. live-spec is a spec-driven pipeline pack;
the user was mid-way through a release. No transcript or private content is
included — the distilled point only.

— drafted for the authors, private; delivery is the user's own step.
```

## outbox/ — where it lands, and where the pack stops

Deposit the note into the host's `outbox/` directory:

- **gitignored** — `outbox/` never rides a push; a private note must not travel with the repo;
- named by date (`outbox/upstream-note-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, a same-day suffix when a second lands);
- **cleared once the human has delivered it** — the human's own step, not the pack's.

The pack's side ends here. It opens **no** network connection and **no** public request on its own —
sending outward is the human's gate (`live-spec-base` rule 17). Delivery upstream is a separate step the
human takes, however they choose (a private message, a private pull request, whatever they name).

## The local record

Record the offer and its answer as one dated line in the host's `FEEDBACK.md` — a sixth line-kind beside
feedback-intake's five routes (`INV-68`):

```
- 2026-07-15 · upstream-note offer · answered yes · outbox/upstream-note-2026-07-15.md
- 2026-07-15 · upstream-note offer · answered no · (no note written)
```

## What it is not

- **Not feedback-intake.** That skill RECEIVES what a person hands in and routes it home; this NOTICES a
  strong moment the agent observed and OFFERS to carry a note up. Opposite arrows. It occupies exactly the
  "never on the agent's own output" seam feedback-intake leaves open (`T-20`).
- **Not a measurement machine.** It reads one moment and offers; it does not score, grade, or aggregate
  sentiment across a conversation or across notes. Reading machinery — plugins, aggregation — stays with
  the measurement family (`INV-21`, deferred).
- **Not an auto-sender.** No yes, no note; and even on a yes, no send — a deposit only.
