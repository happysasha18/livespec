# spec-author

**Author and grow a living product spec as your project develops — structured, honest, and ready for review. A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill.**

Point it at a feature you're about to build, and it writes (or grows) a requirements-genre `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` that states what the product *is* and how its parts compose: entities, states, transitions, actors, invariants, and — the part most specs miss — the **cross-section composition** between surfaces and the views/modes they live under.

It's the authoring half of a pair. **spec-author writes the spec; its sibling [product-prover](https://github.com/happysasha18/product-prover) reviews it.** Same formal-verification primitives on both sides, so the handoff is clean: author → prove → derive tests → code.

## The rule it won't break

> If a situation the system can reach isn't in the spec, the spec is incomplete — even if the code "works."

A spec exists so the next reader (the prover, a teammate, you in three months) can reason about every reachable situation. So spec-author won't silently fill a gap with a guess — it asks the leading question or marks it **⟨DECIDE⟩**. It never invents intent.

Same instinct as **[product-prover](https://github.com/happysasha18/product-prover)** and **[track-coach](https://github.com/happysasha18/track-coach)**: facts over plausible fiction, and the decision always stays with the author.

## The move most specs miss

When a surface carries **state** (a player, a form, an editor), the system usually also has **global axes** it renders under — a compact/detailed view, a quick/full mode, a tier, a screen size, what a reload restores (saved state meeting newer code), and concurrent use where it applies. The bugs that pass every unit test live in the **product** of surface-state × axis, because each was specified alone.

> Real example: a multi-stem audio player was specced as play / mute / solo / seek — clean. But nobody specced what the *compact view* does to it. Solo a part, switch to compact (which hides the controls), and you're left hearing one isolated part with nothing on screen to undo it. Each axis was fine; their product wasn't.

So for every stateful surface, spec-author enumerates it against **each** axis — is the state still visible? still reversible? does the transition preserve, reset, or block it? — and names the composition invariant. And it insists on **one surface, one name**, because a reviewer can only catch a cross-section hole when both sides are named identically and present in the same document.

When a surface persists state beyond the session (localStorage, files, preferences), spec-author enumerates the old-stored-value × current-code cross-section explicitly and demands a stated migrate / ignore / clear rule — the "reopened it and it looked broken" seam.

## What it does

- **Human-first, in product language** — the spec reads in plain product words a person *wants* to keep open, in whatever register fits, whether or not it reads like a textbook. Machine fragments with markup have no place in it. It opens with a closed-vocabulary glossary, then a body of requirements — each a Context block, a one-sentence User Story, and acceptance criteria grouped into named cases — with the prover's codes (`INV-18`, `⟨DECIDE⟩`) trailing as quiet handles at the line-ends. One document serves both the human and the prover — no forked "readable" copy that drifts. Edit history lives in the JOURNAL; the spec states today's truth.
- **The spine** — a completeness checklist every spec must satisfy: Purpose, Entities, States & transitions, Actors, Invariants (safety + liveness), Cross-section composition, and a closed-vocabulary Glossary.
- **Composition pass** — the step above: every stateful surface, multiplied across every view/mode/tier it lives under, with the composition invariant stated.
- **Completeness pass** — a short checklist run before a section is "done": every noun named once, every state has an exit, every transition has an actor, every claim is honest (or ⟨DECIDE⟩), and no second document claims to be the spec.
- **Honest gaps** — domain calls only a human can make are marked ⟨DECIDE⟩ with the question, never guessed.
- **Prover-ready handoff** — written in the same primitives [product-prover](https://github.com/happysasha18/product-prover) reviews, so you author → prove the *whole* spec → derive the test matrix → write code.

## What's inside

No code, no dependencies, nothing to build — spec-author is a single `SKILL.md`: a structured set of authoring instructions Claude follows. Drop it in and ask. Works anywhere Claude Code runs.

---

## Usage

Drop the folder into `~/.claude/skills/spec-author/` and just ask:

> *"start a spec for this"* · *"spec out this feature"* · *"add X to the spec"* · *"keep the spec in sync with what we just built"* · *"how should I structure this spec?"*

Then hand the result to **product-prover** for review before you write tests or code.
