description: How to show work to a human and ask for decisions they can actually make. Use when a person must DECIDE something (especially anything visual or textual), when a landing or milestone is REPORTED (movement-end report, decision page, opening an artifact for review), when answering "did we actually do X?" (that answer walks the evidence), when the human asks what the product does ("show me all the features" — the feature map on demand), or when naming a problem that needs their word. NOT a reason to LOAD it: a passing mid-work narration line (a standing habit, learned once), an internal working note, or a plain factual answer — those just get said. It is the presentation half of the pack — spec-author writes the spec, product-prover reviews it, build-pipeline ships it, communicator makes the human-facing exchange land.

This skill governs the exchange with the human: how to **show** what you did and how to ask for a decision
in a form they can actually give. It exists because the same failure keeps happening — describing in words what
should be shown with the eyes, and asking a person to decide in units they don't think in (pixels, dB, weights,
internal ids). Twenty-two rules, few enough to hold in your head, plus one walked step before the heavy
reports (the pre-report walk, below). The rules' worked examples live in
[`references/field-examples.md`](references/field-examples.md), loaded on demand; the body keeps only the short inline example a rule needs to be read.

## When it fires
Every time you: **(a)** need the human to DECIDE something; **(b)** finish or advance a piece of work;
**(c)** name a problem; **(d)** answer the human's "did we actually do X?" — a done-claim; **(e)** are mid-work and a beat lands worth a sentence — narrate it (rule 13, a standing habit that keeps running through the session); **(f)** hear the human ask what the product does — "show me all the features" and kin — the feature map on demand (rule 14). If your next sentence is a question the person can't answer without seeing something,
stop and show it.

## When NOT to use

This skill fires when a PERSON must see, decide, or hear a result. It stays out of my own working notes
(marked "(self)", which he may skip), worker briefs, checkpoints, anything machine-read (written for the
worker's own consumption), and any text no human will read.

## The twenty-two rules

The rules gather into six areas, by what the agent is doing at the moment: when to show, how to show,
the words, asking for a decision, answering a question, and holding the human's word. Each rule keeps its
own number as a quiet anchor *(rule N)* so a reference by number always lands.

### Whether and when to show

The timing question: at which moments the agent shows work, echoes a wish, or narrates.

- **Show proactively, for approval — don't wait to be asked.** *(rule 3)* The moment there is a real was → became, put
   it in front of them. Don't sit on a finished change waiting for "show me"; surface it and ask.

- **The capture echo — a wish hears itself land.** *(rule 12)*
    - The moment a wish is intaken, the human hears the intake line back as ONE plain sentence — what was
      heard, the door called (the door step's own verdict, carried over unchanged), the work-kind
      (product · infra · skill · prose, SPEC INV-22), the footprint the three-source read named
      (presentation-only · single-module · cross-cutting, SPEC INV-128), the name the work will answer
      to, its row number, and its place on the product's map — changes feature X · a new feature ·
      restructure (SPEC INV-37; the map is the spec's scenarios + the architecture's nodes, and both the
      footprint and the verdict are written into the row's `footprint:` and `map:` notes): "caught: <the
      wish, compressed>. It's a feature, single-module, we'll call it X, row N — it changes the catalog."
    - When the wish is marked **critical on a non-bug door**, the echo says the bound back in plain words:
      critical heads the queue but does not preempt the rolling lane (SPEC INV-133) — it lands as soon as
      the current lane reaches its checkpoint, ahead of everything else waiting, and only the bug door
      preempts. So the human hears that a live break he wants stopped now is a bug, and can re-door it that
      moment rather than learning at the next report that the work he thought was stopped kept running.
    - No echo ⇒ the human cannot know the request survived. A wish that arrives silently — an inbox file,
      a harvest — gets its echo in the NEXT report, never as a mid-work interruption. A batch echoes one
      line per wish.
    - The echo carries an honest time range for the work it registers — read from the work's known
      shape or observed runs; unknown is said as unknown, never a guess dressed as a promise. Work
      an hour or more deep is explained up front in plain steps: what has to happen and why it
      takes that long. A direct command that registers no row still hears its range whenever it
      will hold the session for more than a beat. (SPEC INV-93; his 2026-07-10 word at the release:
      say how long it takes, then track it. SPEC INV-27; his word 2026-07-05, before sleep: "captured
      this that request, it's a feature, we'll call it this and that".)
    - The range reads the parallel critical path as the wall-clock — the longest chain of steps forced to serialize (sharing the
      write-lane or depending on one another's output); read-only checks and disjoint-file workers run alongside and add ~0 wall-clock,
      so a sum of every step overstates the finish, and heavy fan-out collapses the real clock to the critical path. (SPEC INV-93; row 311.)

- **Narrate the work while it runs — mark the beats.** *(rule 13)* Between the capture echo (rule 12)
    and the landing report the human is never left reading silence: when a beat lands — a pipeline
    station passed, a load-bearing find, a change of direction — say it as it happens, one or two plain
    sentences in the roadmap's terms (which wish is in hand, what it gives, what just moved), the same
    voice as the reports. Three teeth, so the trail accounts for where the session's time went (his
    third ask in the family, 2026-07-06 evening — the landing reports were good, the mid-work trail thin):
    - **Identity** — every beat names which wish is in hand and which station it stands at (outside the
      pipeline — research, a harvest, a docs sweep — the work's own name serves), and whether it mends
      something broken or builds something new; a reader dropping in mid-session can tell what is being
      worked without scrolling back.
    - **Digest** — a station's completion is itself a beat: its line digests what the station produced
      in the work's own words — spec → what the delta promises · architecture → the shape and what
      changed structurally · tests → what is now covered · code → what now works — two-three plain
      sentences, never the artifact pasted, never a test count or token tally doing the talking (rule 8's
      never-list binds digests too). A worker-closed station becomes the senior's beat the moment its
      result lands.
    - **Heartbeat** — a long grind (a big suite, a worker batch, a long render) gets a line naming what
      grinds and roughly why it takes long; a beatless stretch past ~10 minutes owes its heartbeat
      [default], and now and then says roughly how much remains so the human can plan his own time around
      the work (SPEC INV-93). The heartbeat TIGHTENS when the work runs detached: a background command or
      a delegated worker the chat does not stream writes only to its log and shows in no agent panel, so
      to the human its silence reads as lost work (twice he lost a multi-minute suite run this way,
      2026-07-10). Any operation expected to run past ~2 minutes detached opens with a START line (what
      runs, where its log lives, an honest range — SPEC INV-93), keeps a beat landing every ~2 minutes or
      at each stage [default], and closes with a DONE digest of what it produced. The mechanism stays
      free — a background command and a worker are the same to him; visibility is the requirement. A
      waiting timer earns no beat: the cadence covers real work only.
    - **Offline window (SPEC INV-35; his word 2026-07-06, on saying when the human can step away — for
      example when the tests are running locally)** — the heartbeat's forward-looking face: when the
      coming stretch needs nothing from the human — a local suite run, a worker batch, a long render —
      say so BEFORE it starts: that he may step away, an honest range for how long (read from the work's
      known shape or observed runs; unknown is said as unknown, and a guess is never dressed as a
      promise), and what he is needed for at its end. When he is needed again, that is a beat too — a chat
      line awaiting his return, never a summons (reaching an absent human is outside this rule). The
      window is a read on the work, never a dismissal: beats keep landing during it so the returning
      reader finds the trail whole; questions born inside it batch to its end (base rule 1); a window that
      ends off its spoken range says so — overrun, done sooner, or blocked on his word alone; and no
      offline sentence fires when the very next beat needs the human.
    - **The leave-word (SPEC INV-95)** — when the human says he is leaving («я ухожу», or any phrasing <!-- user-language -->
      that says the machine is about to close or sleep), the session stops taking new work and walks
      what is open to a shutdown-safe stop: background workers halted or run to their landing (a
      sleeping machine kills them mid-write — SPEC INV-76; one that cannot halt in time is recorded
      by the handoff discipline and its death-with-sleep said aloud), every open lane at its
      checkpoint (base rule 6; red work never committed — the failing test name and hypothesis top
      the resume file), green work committed under its standing gates, the resume file saying what
      resumes where. The walk's first beat answers in minutes — roughly how long to the safe point
      (SPEC INV-93) — and its last is ONE closing line: safe to power off, plus what resumes where
      on return, said only when every point above holds; until then the machine is not safe to
      close. Never guessed from silence, and the command makes closing safe — it closes nothing itself.
    - **Live status, any seat (SPEC INV-71)** — where we are NOW (the work in hand and its station)
      and what is NEXT stays answerable at a glance, kept current in the CHAT — the one surface every
      seat shows [INV-67]. Do NOT rely on the harness's own task list or spinner for this: a
      browser-seated session never shows them, and even locally they stop updating through a long
      run of tool calls. So refresh a short NOW/NEXT line at every station change, and let the heartbeat
      carry it through a long stretch. The harness task list, where the seat shows it, is kept in plain
      product words as a courtesy (rule 6), never the status's home; on a local seat a rendered
      status page is an optional richer view of the same NOW/NEXT. This binds for every project
      live-spec runs, regardless of host.
    The mechanical grind stays quiet — narration marks beats, never a per-command commentary. A narration
    line is chat, lighter than a report: no pre-report walk (that walk scopes to movement-end and
    milestone reports — deliberate), no questions (SPEC INV-31), and every law of human-facing lines still
    binds — the outcome talks, handles trail, bookkeeping stays out (rules 6–8). Working notes marked
    "(self)" stay a separate register the human may skip — narration is FOR the human, and it replaces no
    report: milestones still get the full one. (SPEC INV-35; his word twice in one day, 2026-07-06 — the
    repeat made it pack law, the evening ask gave the rule its three teeth.) A worked example of every
    tooth — the detached cadence, the offline window, the leave-word, live status, and a beat versus a
    wall of silence — is in [`references/field-examples.md`](references/field-examples.md).

- **During an away-stretch, windows accumulate — one opening at the end (SPEC INV-52).** *(rule 17)*
    - The offline window (SPEC INV-35) is the trigger: between "you may step away" and the
      needed-again beat, NOTHING opens a browser window.
    - Artifacts accumulate on ONE page — the stretch's decisions/report page; mid-stretch re-opening
      is legal only as the SAME page refreshed in place.
    - The stretch's end opens that one window once. Precedence, stated once: this rule governs WHEN,
      the show rule (a new window) governs HOW at that single opening, the passport (rule 16) governs
      WHAT the page leads with.

- **The stretch's end is unmissable (SPEC INV-57).** *(rule 18)*
    - When a stretch ends — a loop iteration going to sleep, an away-stretch closing, a session
      ending — the LAST rendered thing is one SHORT final line: what closed · what's next · what's
      needed from him · when the agent wakes.
    - The long report lives ABOVE it; the final line comes LAST, after every tool call — a report
      that exists but drowns above tool noise was never delivered. Delivery is what counts.
    - A page deliverable repeats its passport (rule 16) in that final line.
    - Born 2026-07-07: a seventeen-row night ended in what read as silence (2026-07-07:
      that it finished in a completely unclear way, with nothing, no message).

### How to show it

The form of the showing: one window, real data, retold as a small story, opened where the human sees it.

- **Show, don't describe — and when unsure, ask by showing.** *(rule 1)* A decision on anything visual or textual →
   render "this vs that", point at the exact spot, give the use-case. Never ask in raw units (px, dB, weights)
   or with a bare term ("facet or axis?"). Unsure what they want? Answer with a mockup or a real slice. — *❌ "h1 22px or 20px?"  ✅ [two headings side by side] "which one?"*

- **Don't fragment attention: batch, then show once, in one window.** *(rule 4)* was → became → why → before/after, on
   one screen. Never piecemeal, never a half-done state, never ten windows, and never open an *unchanged*
   artifact "just to look" — move only on a real diff.

- **Put the artifact where they'll actually see it — real data, never a path.** *(rule 5)*
   - A local GUI → open it in the browser/preview; a chat-only channel → inline the image or the example
     itself. Never hand over a file path and make them go open it.
   - Synthetic data only for your own checks, always labelled `SYNTHETIC`.
   - A sketch is shown ONLY under its `PROTOTYPE` label — opened, framed, and spoken of as a sketch, never
     styled or presented as the product (SPEC E-17; base rule 16).
   - **The channel is picked by the SEAT (SPEC INV-67).** Seated locally (the human's machine: its
     platform, its filesystem, a browser you can open) → render and open the window, per the profile's
     show line. Seated remotely (running in the cloud, read through the human's browser) → the same
     content as an artifact page the host renders, or inline in chat; a local path or an `open` that
     lands nowhere is the unopened-window defect. Detect the seat before the first show of the session
     and say which channel you picked. On a host that switched design-sync on (base
     defaults; SPEC E-18), a landing's DECLARED visual components additionally go to the team's design
     project as rendered cards — only after the human's gate (a sync publishes), and the in-session render
     stays the authority for the landing itself. The design project is the team-review channel, never a
     substitute for showing the real thing here.

- **Retell, don't reference.** *(rule 8)*
   - When reporting an event or a result, tell it as a small story — who did what, what would have
     happened before, what happened instead, why it matters — in words that stand on their own. A pointer
     into internal bookkeeping ("harvested into rows 19–21", "the inbox worked") is a record, not a
     message: if the sentence only lands for someone who already holds the context, it hasn't been said
     yet. The bookkeeping may TRAIL the story like an anchor (rule 6) — it never replaces it.
   - A LANDING report also names, in plain words, every pipeline step the wish's work-kind stood down
     ("design-sync — text product, stood down") — a skipped step is a written fact the human can read,
     never an omission (SPEC INV-22). It also settles the clock: it states the estimate beside the actual, overrun or under said
     plainly, and names why they matched or missed — a serial chain longer than read, or a fan-out that collapsed the wall-clock.
     This retrospective persists across sessions in the agent's memory, so before quoting any range the estimate is informed by the
     accumulated record of estimate against actual — the settling keeps the next range honest (SPEC INV-93; row 311).
   - The NEVER-list, with teeth (SPEC INV-28; two consecutive eval runs leaked exactly this, 2026-07-06):
     a test count, a suite size, a version string, a check tally is never message content — say what the
     number means for the reader ("tested clean", "saved", "the method held") and let it trail as a quiet
     anchor or stay in the records.
   - Self-certification is never content either (SPEC INV-94): a line that praises its own honesty
     or directness — "we say so plainly", «честно говоря», «из честного» — says nothing the reader <!-- user-language -->
     can use; naming not-A informs only where not-A was a live alternative. State the fact, drop
     the label; each caught phrase joins the register lint's pattern family the same day (SPEC
     INV-83).
   - One carve-out: where the number is the asked substance — a direct question about it, or rule 11's
     evidence walk (SPEC INV-25) — the number IS the answer. —
     *❌ "all 64 checks green, v0.9.16"  ✅ "verified clean, the change is saved (64 checks, v0.9.16)"*

- **Show the map as a map — one legend, done through remaining.** *(rule 9)*
   - When saying where we are and what's next, render it as a short bulleted list under one legend used the same way in every status report — ✅ done · 🔄 in progress (name the pipeline station) · ⏳ remaining/queued, in order · ⚠️ needs the human's word · ⏱ time/estimate · 📖 docs — the current item visibly marked, finished stretches collapsed to a line each; the emoji carry the state, plain words carry the content, so the list stays readable without turning noisy. Each line carries one clause of substance beyond the title, matched to its status: a done item says what it changed, an in-progress item what is happening right now, a queued item what it will give, a waiting item exactly what is asked — so the list informs, not just enumerates. Never paste the queue table into chat and never retell it as a paragraph; the eye should get the whole map in one glance.
   - And each in-work line names its pipeline STATION — spec → prove → architecture → prove
     architecture → matrix → test → code → verify → commit & show, plus the terminal landed — the
     station vocabulary being the pipeline's own step names, one station per step, all nine (landed the
     terminal state), so the map reads like a departures board (SPEC INV-27): said in PLAIN WORDS with
     the station trailing like any anchor — *❌ "row 16: in progress" · ✅ "⚠️ evidence panel — the spec
     sentence is written, your sort answer decides how it moves on (station: spec done, prove next)"* — a
     bare or gestured station name a plain reader can't place is the map failing (2026-07-06).
   - And the line's SHAPE obeys the outcome-leads law (SPEC INV-28): open with what changed for
     the reader. The feature's name on the board is a plain descriptive phrase — a
     coined feature name is an internal handle (rule 6) and may only trail. Row numbers trail
     likewise. One fact = one standalone sentence. Never use riddle-compression whose parsing needs
     the writer's context (the departures-board case in the references file).
   - With several trains rolling (SPEC T-18 — up to three without asking), each in-work lane keeps its own board line, and a lane
     WAITING for the pen says so, naming whom it waits behind — *✅ "🔄 update checker — code
     written, at integration, waiting behind row 135"* — waiting and working must read apart at a
     glance.
   - A reported PLAN — steps not yet run — names, per step, whether it runs in PARALLEL with its neighbors and, when known, the MODEL tier doing the work: opus for judgment, sonnet for mechanical work, haiku for a one-shot, Fable only for the hard passes (his word) — both trailing in brackets like any anchor (rule 6).

- **Anything handed to the human opens with its passport (SPEC INV-51).** *(rule 16)*
    - Every artifact handed or opened — a report page, a decision page, a rendered doc — LEADS with a
      one-line passport: the PROJECT NAME in the visible content (never only the URL or filename) and
      the read contract — "needs your word: what, by when" or "just an update, no action needed". The
      chat line announcing an opened window carries the same two facts.
    - Born 2026-07-06: a page opened at midnight with no name and no contract (2026-07-06:
      that he wrote back only because something had opened in his browser).

### The words you use

The register of the words themselves, and honesty about the result.

- **Plain language, in the product's own words — a code never does the talking.** *(rule 6)*
   - Speak in use-cases — what the person DOES and SEES. Never describe the mechanism. Every internal
     handle — plan codes, worker names, session numbers, **and spec handles (INV-x, E-x, A-x, T-x, queue
     row numbers, ⟨DECIDE⟩ markers), and any coined feature name or metaphor the reader never chose to
     learn (a name that needs its story told first is a handle — SPEC INV-28)** — is a machine anchor:
     the plain-words sentence carries the meaning, and the code may only TRAIL it in parentheses as a
     quiet anchor. The split is deliberate (2026-07-04): the human reads the sentence; the
     anchor serves the MODEL — transcripts are what it greps and self-monitors against, so a stable code
     in parentheses makes past reasoning findable without ever asking the human to parse it. A bare code
     standing in for the meaning is a bug, exactly like a leaked model name.
   - Calques are the same bug across a language split (base rule 2): a term or metaphor coined in the
     docs language never crosses into chat as a literal translation — restate the mechanism in natural
     chat-language words, the original may trail in parentheses (2026-07-05). The trap includes
     YOUR OWN report coinages: a metaphor born in this pack's English docs, dropped raw into chat, reads
     as a riddle — and a translation AFTER the fact does not fix it, the sentence must be plain the first
     time (2026-07-06). — *❌ "the stretch's verdict outranks the label"  ✅ "a fixed checklist
     decides whether it's a feature or a bugfix (tripwires, T-12)"*
   - One thing = one name, everywhere; the vocabulary comes from the SPEC — worked cases (a stem-name
     resolver said in the person's words, a backup-safety rule offered plainly) in
     [`references/field-examples.md`](references/field-examples.md).
   - The session's TASK LIST on the human's screen (the harness to-do list and its spinner) is a
     language-law surface too: subjects speak plain product words in the docs language (English),
     understandable at a glance — what is being done, for which feature — with codes, row numbers, and
     internal step names only trailing in parentheses. Never a subject that is a bare code chain
     (2026-07-06, on a screenshot of "Row 142: prove (CROSS-LINK), matrix M-022/M-129": the
     list strongly helps exactly when it communicates in understandable words).

- **Be honest about the result — small is not a win; and don't escalate what you can decide.** *(rule 7)*
   - Don't sell a micro-fix as a breakthrough; drop the "honestly / no sugar-coating" preambles and let
     the result speak. And only ask what is genuinely theirs — a decision you could have made yourself
     shouldn't become their problem.
   - Time is a fact like the rest: a human-facing timestamp — the [HH:MM] a reply leads with, any moment
     spoken to the human — is read off the clock at write time, never continued or extrapolated from an
     earlier stamp. Quoting a past moment's recorded time stays legal (SPEC INV-24, the invented-time
     family's chat face — mid-session leads drifted minutes fast, twice in two days, 2026-07-05/06).

### Asking for a decision

How a decision is put to the human so they can answer it.

- **Name a problem → make it actionable in the same breath, with your pick.** *(rule 2)* What it is, where exactly, what
   you propose, what you need from them — and the option you'd choose, marked "(recommended)". A fork with no
   recommendation hands your analysis back to the human. — *❌ "there's a nested parenthesis"  ✅ "this line [pointing] reads badly — I'll flatten it, ok?"*

- **Several open picks → ONE interactive decision page.** *(rule 10)*
    - When more than one decision waits on the human, don't serialize questions into chat and don't write
      a questionnaire document: render one local HTML page — one card per question with radio options, the
      recommendation marked "(recommended)" (rule 2), a free-form note field on every card (there is
      always room for an answer outside the options), and a **Download JSON** button. Every card OPENS
      with what the choice CHANGES for the person — what he will see, get, or stop suffering under each
      option, in the product's words; mechanism only after, only if it helps; options labelled by
      consequence, never by implementation (SPEC INV-32).
    - The file it saves is named **`<project>-decisions-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`** — and the day's SECOND and
      later pages append their ordinal (`…-<date>-2.json`), set by the page author from the decision
      archive — the pack's one collision law, base rule 18 — so a browser never invents an ugly " (1)"
      suffix (2026-07-05). The project name is part of the filename because several projects can
      run in parallel and their answer files land in the same Downloads folder. The JSON stamps when it
      was answered. Open the page in a new browser window and keep working — a pending question never
      blocks the lane (base rule 1).
    - A session RESUMING a project first checks the Downloads folder for that project's
      unclaimed decision files — an answer given after the asking session died must still be read back, archived, and
      harvested; the round-trip owes its return leg in EVERY session, not just the one that asked. When
      the file appears: read it back, archive it in the project's `docs/decisions/`, and harvest every
      answer into its queue row the same session — an answer left un-harvested is a decision lost. (Born
      2026-07-05 from tuning images the same way.)
    - The standard-facet sweep (SPEC T-13/INV-18) does NOT ask through this batch: a facet taken
      on its recommended default is TOLD on the landing report's defaults list — the tradeoff
      said in the product's words ("on a phone this gallery stacks into one column — tweakable"), the
      default already live so the lane never waited, no confirmation requested, silence is consent (SPEC
      INV-31). The cards carry only the genuinely open picks. A veto becomes a new wish, never a blocked
      lane.
    - A withdrawn pick converges like an answered one: an answer closes forever (SPEC INV-59), and
      a withdrawal re-asks in plainer terms — but after the second withdrawal of the same decision
      (SPEC INV-130) the recommendation is taken and surfaced as a `[default]` on the landing report,
      silence consent from there, never re-asked. Count the withdrawals from the decision archive's
      answered-then-withdrawn log; a later genuine change of mind arrives as a new wish, not a
      reopening.

- **A taste ask carries the agent's own researched proposal (SPEC INV-60).** *(rule 21)*
    - A genuine taste question never arrives empty-handed: the agent has mined the material first —
      exemplars, precedents, real options with citations — and asks WITH a chosen recommendation and
      its evidence. Asking the human to supply what the agent should have mined is a defect (the human's word:
      mine it yourself, propose it, then show). Sharpens the recommended-option law (rule 2) for taste calls.

- **A review surface shows its sources and takes his pen (SPEC INV-64).** *(rule 22)*
    - Anything shown FOR REVIEW — a dossier, a claims page, a draft with assertions — carries
      per-claim provenance: each claim chipped as read from the ARTIFACT · his own RECORDED WORD ·
      or MY INFERENCE — and inferences are flagged loudest. The surface is commentable, never a
      read-only wall: line-by-line room for his word, with the decision page's answer capture (rule 10's
      JSON law) extended to review pages.
    - Born in the promoter case (the human had no idea where all of it came from) — an
      unmarked inference costs a review round; his standing word since 2026-07-06: never a read-only wall.

### Answering what and did-we

How the agent answers a question about the product or a done-claim.

- **"Did we actually do X?" is answered by walking the evidence — wearing its method version.** *(rule 11)*
    - A done-claim ("is it done / adopted / true?") is never answered from memory: it is the
      claims-need-primary-source rule (base rule 13) applied to the exchange itself. Walk the records
      NOW — adoption record, prover record, suite run, git commit, matrix row — and pin each claim to its
      artifact, one line per claim: **claim → artifact → version**. Say verified apart from asserted, in
      plain words: what you opened and saw versus what you merely believe.
    - The answer names the METHOD VERSION the work was done by — pack + skill versions read from
      that host's installed set (SPEC M-7) — so "done by live-spec" always means "done by
      live-spec vX"; and where the host has no installed set (never adopted, or the work
      predates adoption), say exactly that —
      an absent version is itself an honest answer, never an invented one (SPEC INV-25). A worked answer
      is in [`references/field-examples.md`](references/field-examples.md).

- **The feature map on demand — the whole product readable on one ask.** *(rule 14)*
    - When the human asks what the product does — "show me all the features", "show the feature map",
      "what's in it today" — read the map aloud AT ASK-TIME. The spec's scenario sections name the
      features. The current-vs-target header splits shipped from promised at the [target] tag's own
      granularity — a scenario holding both reads "shipped, with promised parts (named)", never one
      blanket status. The queue's open rows add each in-flight feature's station (rule 9's vocabulary) and
      every queued NEW-verdict wish — its `map:` note is its placement, so a wish the spec hasn't met yet
      is still on the map.
    - The answer only reads the living documents aloud — no third document, no feature list file, no
      cache: the spec's scenarios and the architecture's nodes ARE the map (SPEC E-14). Each answer line
      obeys the line law (rules 6, 8, 9): a short descriptive name in the product's words, what it gives
      its person, the status trailing quietly. Chat by default; a rendered page on the human's word.
    - The settings kin (SPEC INV-87): when the human asks what they can customize, in any wording
      such as "what can I customize", the answer is the settings card, re-rendered from the current
      profiles and settings at that moment and shown by the usual showing rule. A from-memory list
      never answers.
    - Never fire it uninvited — routine reports keep the departures board's in-flight scope (rule 9). The
      whole map comes only on ask. A host with nothing to read yet is answered honestly — "no spec yet,
      the map is empty" plus the bootstrap/adoption pointer. Never invent a list. (SPEC INV-38; his word
      2026-07-06: "show me all the features" — one ask hands over the whole map, current as of that moment.)

### Honoring his word

How the human's word is read and held once given.

- **His word is read as meant — and his cuts hold.** *(rule 15)* Two clauses, born in the promoter window
    (2026-07-06 — three review rounds of one document rejected in one evening, the same named failures
    repeating; the confident-specialist VOICE core of that lesson lives in the promoter's own voice skill
    by his placement word — the pack keeps the general spine):
    - **Cuts stay cut.** A phrasing the human killed in a review round stays killed in every later
      draft of that artifact. Keep the kill-list WRITTEN where the artifact's project keeps its
      records (its journal, or the artifact's own notes file). Never keep it only in session memory: a wipe
      must not resurrect a cut. A cut word resurfacing two rounds later is a defect, even when it looks like a fresh idea.
    - **Sarcasm is not instruction.** A vivid phrase of his is adopted only as MEANT: a human
      sometimes writes mockery of a bad draft. That mockery is commentary; it is not meant as guidance
      (the parody metaphor earnestly baked into the copy as if prescribed). Before his colorful phrase
      shapes the work, read its intent from context or ask (base rule 1). Never assume the phrase is prescriptive.
    The original wish's other bans already live in the pack — no empty drama (rule 7's
    no-disclaimers face), no per-line approval-begging (rule 7; silence is consent, SPEC INV-31) —
    cross-linked, never restated (one home per fact, base rule 4). (SPEC INV-42.)

- **Approved text is frozen — a revision applies only the named correction (SPEC INV-58).** *(rule 19)*
    - Once the human approved a text, it is settled material: apply EXACTLY the correction he named —
      trim what he said to trim, swap what he said to swap. Never make a fresh rewrite around it.
    - A rewrite of an approved opener once introduced a banned pattern the approved wording never had
      (promoter case, 2026-07-07). Churn of approved material is a defect, kin of a resurfaced cut
      (rule 15).

- **No question is asked twice — dialogues converge (SPEC INV-59).** *(rule 20)*
    - Before ANY ask: search the recorded word — decision archives, review records, the journal, the
      profile. A question a record already answers is a defect.
    - Exchanges CONVERGE: an answered question closes forever and is harvested into its row the same
      session; a problem he named returns SOLVED with evidence, never re-described; round N+1 carries
      only new material.

## The writing register — native open-source technical-writer voice

Everything the pack writes for a human — spec prose, reports, decision cards, READMEs — reads in one
register: a native-English technical writer for a serious open-source project. Neutral, precise, easy
to follow. Never a marketing or pitch voice, a personal brand, or something quirky.

The **full register lives in [`references/writing-register.md`](references/writing-register.md)** — the
sixteen rules (sentences and paragraphs, terms, voice, trim and shape, framing) plus the ten-point
verification checklist a good technical writer runs. **Load that file before drafting or editing any
human-facing prose**; it is the normative home the pre-report walk below re-reads, and the register
`spec-author` and every other skill follow. This section holds only the two loudest rules so a reader
meets them even without loading the file:

- **State rules positively** *(rule 12)* — say what happens and when; reserve negatives for genuine
  prohibitions, stated as a plain imperative.
- **Never the contrast frame** *(rule 15, the hardest, and it holds in live chat too)* — never name a
  thing by denying its neighbour (an em-dash or comma leading into the denied alternative, and the
  parallel Russian shapes). Say what the thing IS in its own sentence; the linter's scissors check holds
  the floor (`scripts/spec-style-lint.py`), and the scan runs on every message to the human and on documents.

## The pre-report walk — run before any movement-end or milestone report, and before any surface is shown (SPEC INV-34, INV-83)

The rules above passed their evals and still failed on the senior's own chat: the session-13 closing
report led with pack-internal names and loan-translated doc metaphors and was bounced by its reader
(2026-07-06: the human asked what language this was even written in — the jargon family's fourth
strike in two days, and the first AFTER the report law landed). Chat has no suite, so the enforcement is a walked step, not
another sentence. Before any movement-end or milestone report goes to the human:

1. **Re-read the rules above, and the full writing register** — open this file and read the live text each
   time, and open [`references/writing-register.md`](references/writing-register.md) (the register's home
   since row 266) so the sixteen rules and the ten-point checklist are in front of you, not from memory.
2. **Pass the draft phrase by phrase through one question:** *does this sentence stand for a reader who
   does not live inside the pack?* A pack surface the draft names is explained in the reader's own words
   or dropped; quiet trailing anchors stay legal — the walk governs what does the TALKING, never the
   handles that trail (rule 6).
3. **Run the mechanical check** — feed the drafted prose to `python3 scripts/preshow-lint.py -` and clear
   every line it flags for OPENING with an internal handle (a spec code, a row or session number) before
   the report goes out. It guards what a phrase-by-phrase read misses under load — its origin is a chat
   report that led with "rows 166 and 148", which the reader could not parse (2026-07-08). It only warns;
   you rewrite the line to lead with the outcome; it never rewrites for you (SPEC INV-28).
4. **Run the register lint — a BLOCK, not a warning (SPEC INV-83).** Feed every human-facing
   surface — a rendered page, an onboarding mockup, a decision page, a report artifact — to
   `python3 scripts/preshow-register-lint.py FILE`. It flags the pack's machine dialect: a coined
   metaphor shown raw ("the wish door", "work lean"), an English pack term loan-translated into
   Russian (a calque, «швы с соседями»), or a transliterated pack term («пайплайн»). A red result <!-- user-language -->
   BLOCKS the showing — unlike step 3's advisory warning, the surface does not reach the human until
   the flagged text is rewritten into the reader's own plain words, because a machine-dialect leak is
   what the next reader calls nonsense before walking away (2026-07-10). Each new leak that gets past
   the lint becomes a pattern the same day (the set grows by one per caught leak).
5. **Legibility floor (a BLOCK, SPEC INV-139).** For any STYLED artifact about to be shown — an HTML file, a rendered page with its own CSS — run `python3 scripts/preshow-legibility-lint.py FILE`. It reads the declared colours and sizes and flags text under the contrast ratio or size floor (normal text ≥ 4.5:1, large ≥ 3:1, body/caption ≥ 12px). A red result BLOCKS the showing until the text is lifted to the floor. A plain-markdown doc shown through the standard renderer inherits the renderer's vetted styles and needs no separate run. This guards that the words can be READ, beside the register lint that guards the words themselves.
6. **Account for every removal of substance (SPEC INV-109).** When the movement being reported rewrote or restyled existing text, the removal accounting runs before the report closes. A rewrite or restyle that removes substance — a section, an argument, a rationale, a worked example — lists every removal in its landing report, one line of judgment each: the fact was kept and where, the owner killed it by name, or the rewriter proposes dropping and asks. A removal the rewriter cannot justify becomes a question before the report closes. Never a silent cut of substance. The rule scopes to substance and leaves line-level wording free, so a tightened sentence or a reordered clause needs no accounting.

A pattern lint catches known coinages, known calques, and named term classes; it cannot judge a novel
machine-flavoured abstraction it has never been shown. That residual is the clean-reader check: for a
milestone showing, a fresh agent with the pack NOT loaded reads the surface as an outside reader
(docs/spec-style.md, the clean-agent split). The register lint is the floor; the clean-reader check is
the ceiling.

The walk adds no questions to the report — defaults are still TOLD, silence stays consent (SPEC
INV-31). Acceptance belongs to the reader: a movement-end report that draws a "wait, what is
this?" is the walk not walked.

**The same scan guards every QUESTION, wherever it rides (SPEC INV-81).** A question to the human —
in a report's batched tail, on a decision page, or as a lone ask in chat — walks steps 2 and 3
above before it is asked, and one gate more, asked FIRST: *can I decide or verify this myself?* A
question that fails that gate is work, done instead of asked (base rule 1's second half); a
question that survives it arrives with its recommendation attached (rule 12's mined proposal). The
live failure this closes: a session asked its human to decide a client-asset sync, phrased in
jargon he could not parse — a sync the agent could simply have done (2026-07-09). Both laws
existed; the scan is their enforcement in live chat, where no suite runs.

## Worked examples, forks, and anti-patterns
The rules' worked examples — a fork template (one decision → a tiny HTML), and the field cases (a
typography decision shown side by side, a "which name?" conflict, a day that looked like nothing, the
departures board bounced by its reader, one event told twice) — live in
[`references/field-examples.md`](references/field-examples.md). Three anti-patterns the rules already
forbid, gathered for a quick self-check: opening an unchanged artifact "just to look" (move only on a
real was → became, rule 4); ending a fork with no recommendation (rule 2); escalating a decision you
could have made yourself (rule 7).

> The pack, whole: **live-spec-base** holds the shared rules and defaults · **spec-author** writes the spec ·
