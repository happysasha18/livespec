#
# What this does, in plain English:
#
# The live-spec pack (this repo) is the single source of truth for every skill
# under skills/<name>/. Some of those skills ALSO exist as their own separate
# public GitHub repos (e.g. happysasha18/product-prover), kept around so people
# who only want one skill don't have to clone the whole pack. Those standalone
# repos are READ-ONLY MIRRORS — nobody should edit them directly, and this
# script is the one thing that updates them.
#
# For every skill folder in skills/:
#   1. Look for a GitHub repo named happysasha18/<skill-name>.
#      - If it doesn't exist, we do NOT create one (that's a deliberate,
#        separate decision the project owner makes) — we just print that we
#        skipped it and move on.
#   2. If it exists, clone it into a scratch directory, replace its contents
#      with the current skills/<skill-name>/ folder from the pack (keeping the
#      mirror's own .git history), make sure its README.md opens with a banner
#      explaining it's a read-only mirror, stamp the "made with live-spec" line
#      (current pack version) on its README.md and SKILL.md, and if anything
#      actually changed, commit and push that to the mirror repo.
#   3. If nothing changed, we say "up to date" and don't make an empty commit.
#
# This script only ever pushes to the STANDALONE MIRROR repos, never to the
# pack repo itself — the pack's own push is a separate, human-gated step.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/sync-mirrors.sh
#   ./scripts/sync-mirrors.sh --print-release-history   # print the generated section, touch nothing
#
# Requires: git, rsync, and the GitHub CLI (`gh`), already authenticated.

set -euo pipefail

# The release-history generator below does byte-oriented string work (cutting/stripping
# around the multibyte em-dash "—" and the "·" separator). Under the C locale those bytes
# get split mid-character, producing mojibake — and CI defaults to LC_ALL=C. Pin a UTF-8
# locale here, before any of that computation runs, regardless of what the caller's own
# environment set; prefer en_US.UTF-8, fall back to C.UTF-8, else leave the inherited
# locale alone rather than erroring on a host with neither installed.
# The locale list is captured into a variable first, not piped straight into grep: under
# `set -o pipefail`, `grep -q`'s early exit on the first match sends SIGPIPE back to a
# still-writing `locale -a`, which then reports a non-zero (141) exit that pipefail promotes
# to the whole pipeline's status — silently defeating this very `if`, even though grep DID match.

# A mirror also carries a generated "## Release history" section on its README.md — one line

# version story, without cloning the whole pack. Computed ONCE from the PACK's own git log
# (never hand-written on a mirror, where it would go stale), before the mirror loop even starts.
#
# A release commit's subject reads (in this repo's real log): an optional "live-spec " or "v"
# prefix, a semver X.Y.Z, then a separator (space, colon, em-dash, or hyphen), then the story —
# e.g. "v2.1.1 — the day-after sweep: the register floor widens... (rows 354/356/357/358)" or
# "live-spec 1.10.1 — the launch sweep clears stale temp litter by age, safely (ROADMAP 333, PATCH)".
# `git log` lists newest-first, so per distinct version we keep OVERWRITING as we scan down —
# the LAST write for a version is its OLDEST matching commit (the bump commit itself; a newer
# follow-up commit for the same version, e.g. "2.0.0: prover record covers the pushed state",
# is seen earlier in the scan and loses). The ORDER a version first appears in, though, is kept
# (that's already newest-release-first — exactly the order we want to print in).

# The headline/detail split has to be paren-aware: a subject like "...pack version (his word:
# the line doubles as the adoption tracker): made with..." has its FIRST ": " sitting INSIDE
# the parenthetical (a plain string cut would leave a dangling "(his word" fragment). Scan
# character by character, tracking paren depth, and cut at the first ": " or ". " seen at
# depth 0 — everything from there on is detail, dropped. If none is found outside parens, the
# whole story is kept (and any trailing parenthetical is still stripped below).
