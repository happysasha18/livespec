"""preshow-register-lint.py — the mechanical register gate for anything SHOWN to a human (SPEC INV-83).

Why this exists, and how it differs from its neighbour preshow-lint.py:
  preshow-lint.py catches a human-facing line that OPENS with an internal handle (a spec code, a
  row/session number) — a placement tell. THIS lint catches a different disease on the same surface:
  the pack's machine dialect leaking into the words themselves — a coined internal metaphor shown raw
  ("the wish door", "work lean"), an English pack term loan-translated into Russian chat (a calque,
  «швы с соседями» for "seams with neighbours"), or a transliterated pack term («пайплайн»). The law
  it mechanizes is the profile's `language.no-calques` + `language.register`: Russian human-facing text
  NEVER loan-translates the pack's English doc terms, industry-standard words only, and internal
  coinages live in the DOCS only — never in a mockup, a report, a decision page, or a rendered artifact
  a new reader sees first. A caught leak is what «это бред» sounds like from the next user (2026-07-10).

  The two lints stay separate scripts on purpose; the senior decides any merge. Run BOTH at the
  pre-show gate.

What it can and cannot do (stated honestly, so no one over-trusts it):
  A PATTERN lint catches KNOWN coinages, KNOWN calques, and named term classes — the leaks already
  seen. It CANNOT judge a novel machine-flavoured abstraction it has never been shown ("everything
  comes up naturally when it first matters" is only caught because that exact leak was once folded in
  as a pattern). That residual — a fresh abstraction in the same machine register — is held by the
  REGISTER JUDGE (register_judge_core.py, SPEC INV-203): the same class-reading model the chat surface
  uses, pointed at the document a human reads. It hands the file's text and the document register law to
  the cheapest tier and takes back the sentences that leak the machine dialect, catching the class a
  fixed pattern list never could. This lint is the free first pass; the judge is the ceiling.

The list grows by NOBODY's duty (SPEC INV-83, retracted 2026-07-17). The old doctrine grew this list by
one per caught leak, per leak, forever — the pack's own head rule says a list is the wrong answer to a
class, and a growing list is still a list, always one escape behind the next word. The judge holds the
class; the list stays only as the free first pass for what it already happens to cover, and it earns no
new pattern by duty. A Russian fixture carrying this list's OWN listed coinages as calques passed it
clean when probed 2026-07-17 — the worked proof that the list cannot hold its own class.

Design rule that keeps the accepted reader docs green: a pattern is the SPECIFIC coined collocation,
never its ordinary constituent words. "station", "door", "lean", "full" are legitimate industry words
the reader docs use freely; only the coinages "pipeline station", "wish door", "work lean", "full
rigor" are flagged. Verified 2026-07-10: the nine accepted reader docs contain the constituent words
but none of the coinages.

Usage: preshow-register-lint.py FILE [FILE ...]      (or: cat text | preshow-register-lint.py -)
Exit 0 = clean · exit 1 = at least one pattern hit (printed with file, line, pattern id, source).
