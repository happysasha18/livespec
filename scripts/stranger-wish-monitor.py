"""The stranger-door monitor (INV-147, ROADMAP row 261).

A stranger — a contributor with no push rights and no per-repo grant who can still open a
GitHub Issue — has no git path into the repo. This monitor is the bridge: it lists the open
stranger Issues, and for each that has not yet been surfaced at its current activity generation
it writes ONE new inbox/ file naming the source Issue and its source field, COMMITS that file
(touching inbox/ only, the source in the message — the same committed-file law the local and
remote arms obey [E-11, INV-112]), and records the surfaced generation on the Issue. From that
committed file on, the item is an ordinary inbox wish swept by the inbox law under its
git-atomic harvest [T-10, INV-11]. The monitor holds NO verdict: whether an item is a wish,
feedback, or neither stays the inbox sweep's call [T-20].

New stranger activity has an actor: the monitor records, at surfacing time, the Issue's update
generation AS IT STANDS AFTER ITS OWN MARKER — the marker comment's createdAt — and on each run
re-surfaces an Issue whose current generation is newer than the one it recorded. Recording the
post-marker generation is what keeps the monitor from re-surfacing an Issue on its own marker
every run: next run the Issue's updatedAt equals that createdAt, so it reads as no new activity,
and only another actor's edit or comment advances it. So a reopened, edited, or commented swept
Issue is seen again rather than sitting durably-recorded but operationally invisible [INV-138].

The surfacing decision is a PURE function of (open items, the generation each was last surfaced
at, existing inbox files), so a crash between depositing and recording still surfaces an item
exactly once. The process is single-instance by a lock (stale locks are stolen by age), and a
run that cannot reach the repo fails honestly [INV-67] — it names the reach it lacks, logs, and
retries on its next scheduled run, dropping no wish silently.

The bridge serves both Issues and Discussions: Issues over the `gh issue` commands, Discussions
over the GraphQL path (`gh api graphql`). Both are recorded by a hidden marker comment carrying
the surfaced generation, so neither needs a label.

Where two hosts' monitors watch one repo they converge on a single surfacing (INV-149): before a
host deposits, it posts a claim comment on the shared item carrying its host identity and deposits
only when its own claim wins the shared comment log (the earliest live claim, the lower host id
breaking a tie — a pure reading every host computes alike). A claim is the per-host lock lifted
onto the repo and stolen by age the same way, so a host that claims then dies cannot swallow the
wish — a surviving host wins past the stale claim and surfaces it. claim_winner / parse_claims are
pure and unit-tested; _claim wires the `gh` comment post and the read-back.

The core (items_to_surface / surface_key / single_instance / run) carries no I/O and is unit
-tested in tests/test_stranger_door.py. main() wires the `gh` CLI and the inbox/ directory.
