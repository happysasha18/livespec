"""check-shipped-language.py — the machine that holds the English + no-personal-names
line on SHIPPED artifacts (ROADMAP row 275, SPEC INV-120). Composes with row 274, which
states the impersonal voice; this script is the machine that holds it.

Three MECHANICAL offences, each reported as file:line so the fix is mechanical:
  (1) cyrillic      a Cyrillic character outside a deliberately-emitted user-language string
  (2) owner-name    a personal name in a shipped spec / README / skill / code comment or prose,
                    matched against the DECLARED ALPHABET's out-of-alphabet name patterns held in
                    the allowlist data (ROADMAP 417) — so this code names no person
  (3) project-name  a foreign project's name, or a dated-incident provenance turn (a project name
                    beside an ISO date), in a CORE SPEC (SPEC INV-245). A core spec states the rule
                    that holds and leaves the project it was first met on and the day it was met to
                    the diaries; a sibling project's name coupled into a core spec binds the spec to
                    a neighbour it should not know, and a dated incident is history the spec carries
                    in place of the diaries that own it. Distinct rationale from (2): cross-project
                    coupling and history leaking into the spec, riding this same gate's mechanism.
                    The forbidden project names are held as allowlist DATA under
                    `project_name_patterns`, so this code names no project. SCOPE: PRODUCT_SPEC.md
                    and ARCHITECTURE.md are STRICT (a bare project name, or one beside an ISO date,
                    reds); TEST_MATRIX.md reds a dated-incident provenance turn while it permits the
                    fixture-ledger's own kind names (a bare name with no adjacent date) and a
                    project-name substring of a test-function name (word-bounded, so it never
                    matches). A package that declares no project_name_patterns leaves this arm inert.

The wish names a FURTHER offence — a coined non-English metaphor where a plain English term
belongs. That is NOT mechanically reliable (a metaphor is a judgement, not a pattern), so
this script deliberately does NOT attempt it: it is left to the human and to the existing
register lints (scripts/spec-style-lint.py — machine-jargon, scissors). Silence here is not
a clean bill on it.

SHIPPED SET (the files a reader outside this machine meets). Spared, by design, are the
local-only diaries and the fixture homes: JOURNAL.md, ROADMAP.md, NEXT_STEPS.md, MIGRATION.md,
and everything under docs/, attic/, inbox/, .live-spec/, tests/, evals/, prototype/ (a
fenced sketch is not shipped product, SPEC INV-17 — and a prod allowlist may not point into
it, so the exclude, not a glob, is its home). The gate's own
machinery is spared too — this detector's own source and its allowlist name the very tokens
they exist to catch, so scanning them would report the detector's patterns as offences.

ALLOWLIST (scripts/shipped-language-allowlist.json — same dated-debt shape as spec-waivers.json,
the equivalence-gate rule: a NEW offence reds, a listed one is counted debt, never a silent pass):
  declared_alphabet   : {out_of_alphabet_name_patterns:[...]} the shipped set's declared alphabet
                        (ASCII English + program strings). A personal name is out-of-alphabet content;
                        its patterns live here as DATA so this code names no person, and covering a
                        collaborator is one line here. A package declaring none leaves the name arm inert.
  project_name_patterns : [...] the foreign project names a CORE SPEC must not carry (SPEC INV-245),
                        held here as DATA so this code names no project; a package declaring none
                        leaves the project-name arm inert. Cross-project coupling and history leaking
                        into a spec, distinct from the personal-name arm above.
  project_name_waivers : [{file, snippet, note, added}] pre-existing project-name debt, counted.
  user_language_globs : files whose Cyrillic is deliberate program data. Cyrillic in them
                        is never an offence.
  authorship_globs    : files where an owner name is a legitimate authorship byline (LICENSE,
                        the plugin manifest's author field, a copyright line). Never an offence.
  cyrillic_waivers    : [{file, snippet, note, added}] pre-existing Cyrillic debt, counted.
  name_waivers        : [{file, snippet, note, added}] pre-existing owner-name debt, counted.
Region rule: Cyrillic inside a fenced ```user ... ``` block, or on a line carrying an inline
marker (`user-language` in a trailing #/<!-- --> comment), is a deliberate sample and spared.

Usage:
  check-shipped-language.py [--root DIR] [--allowlist FILE] [FILE ...]
Exit 0 = no active offence (waived debt may print) . Exit 1 = at least one active offence.
