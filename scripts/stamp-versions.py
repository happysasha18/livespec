"""stamp-versions.py — version is one fact (SPEC INV-178).

The root VERSION file is the pack version's one home. Every skill's frontmatter `version:` line
and every in-text base-version reference ("`live-spec-base` (vX.Y.Z)") is a stamped COPY of that
fact, written by this script and held by a guard test — a per-skill version hand-rolled at edit
time drifts the moment attention does (ten skills carried ten unrelated numbers before this law).
Run it at every version bump; idempotent. Prints old -> new per change, nothing when current.
