# Installs the canonical pack hooks (SPEC INV-173) on this machine, universal tier only. Idempotent:
# re-running changes nothing once installed. These mechanisms ship here:
#   - the scissors-scan Stop hook (the literal contrast-frame scan);
#   - the answer-first arm (a lead-less wall notice, SPEC INV-220);
#   - the hedge-scan Stop hook (the literal offering-hedge scan, SPEC INV-238);
#   - the register judge (register_judge_core.py + register-judge.py + the async collect/report arms),
#     the class-reading model judge that holds what a literal list cannot (SPEC INV-203). Its universal
#     law ships in the mechanism; its personal laws ride ~/.claude/hooks/register-judge-personal.md.
# The personal overlays (scissors-personal.json, hedge-personal.json, register-judge-personal.md) are
# owned entirely by the personal layer — this script never creates or edits them.
#
# Usage: install-pack-hooks.sh [--dry-run]
#   --dry-run   print what would be done, touch nothing. Honors $HOME as-is (no hardcoded path),
#               so a test can point it at a scratch HOME without ever touching the real one.
