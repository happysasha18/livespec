"""Stop-hook: catch the scissors / empty-contrast frame in outgoing chat (SPEC INV-173).

Canonical pack copy, universal tier only: the English contrast-by-denial frame ("X, not Y",
"X — not Y") is a pack law every host inherits. A host's own extra patterns (another language, a
narrower personal rule) never live here — they load from an optional overlay file
`~/.claude/hooks/scissors-personal.json` (a JSON list of regex strings), owned by the personal
layer; this file never creates or edits that overlay. Missing or malformed overlay falls back to
universal-only, silently.

Reads the last assistant turn from the transcript and scans it for the scissors markers. A line
demonstrated inside «guillemets», "double quotes", or `backticks`, and any line inside a fenced
``` code block, is stripped before matching — quoting the banned frame to talk ABOUT it is not
itself a live instance of it. A surviving match BLOCKS the stop with a rewrite instruction.
