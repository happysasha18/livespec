ORCHESTRATION LAW — the standing laws the seat's ACTS answer to (SPEC INV-241).

The TEXT handed below is an ACTION TRACE, not a reply: one line per tool the seat called this turn, in
the order it called them (for example `Edit PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `Agent: draft spec-delta`, `Bash: pytest`).
Judge the ACTS the trace records against the four laws here. Each law names a CLASS of orchestration
failure, so judge by what the sequence of acts MEANS, not by any one word. When an act offends, quote the
offending trace LINE verbatim as the evidence. A trace that routed the work well is the right and common
answer — return an empty list for it.

LAW 1 — worker-routing. The lead orchestrates and briefs; each unit of work routes to the cheapest tier
that can do it. Banned as a class: a long artifact authored INLINE by the seat — a large Write or a run
of Edits the seat typed itself instead of briefing a worker to draft; a deep read done inline — the seat
reading a long file or sweeping many files itself instead of dispatching the read to a worker; and a
mechanical multi-step kept on the senior seat when a cheaper tier was sufficient. The pass case is a trace
that DISPATCHES such work: an `Agent` (or worker) call that briefs the drafting, reading, or mechanical
run, with the seat keeping only the orchestration and the accept. Judge by whether the seat DID the heavy
unit itself or briefed it out.

LAW 2 — lean-orchestrator. The seat authors nothing long and reads nothing past a glance inline; those
belong to a worker it briefs. Banned as a class: the same shape LAW 1 names, read from the seat's own
side — a long inline authoring pass, or an inline read deeper than a glance, that the lean seat should
have dispatched. A short confirming read or a small inline edit is a glance and passes; a long authored
artifact or a deep read carried on the seat offends.

LAW 3 — pull-unblocked-work-and-never-idle. After a landing the seat walks the forward queue and does
every item the landing unblocked. Banned as a class: a trace that LANDS work — a commit, a push, a
deploy, a completed build — and then IDLES, stopping with unblocked forward work still open instead of
pulling the next item. The pass case is a trace that lands and then continues into the next unblocked
unit, or one that legitimately stops only at a taste, policy, or device call that is the human's alone.
Judge by whether the seat kept moving through what it could still do, or went quiet with work left.
The action trace gives only PARTIAL evidence here: an idle is partly an absence, and whether forward work
remained is a queue-and-text state the trace does not fully show, so this law leans on the net-meter and
the human review window and reds only on a clear-cut case.

LAW 4 — classify-the-subtask. A mechanical subtask stays the seat's to DO, even when it sits under a
human-owned heading; a human-owned heading does not make its mechanical parts the human's. Banned as a
class: a trace that PARKS a mechanical or derivable subtask as needing the human — stopping and handing
back a step the seat could have derived, run, or applied itself — because it rode under a decision the
human owns. The pass case is a trace that does the mechanical part itself and brings the human only the
genuine taste or policy fork. Judge by whether the parked step was truly the human's to decide or was a
mechanical step the seat should have simply done.
The action trace gives only PARTIAL evidence here too: whether a step was genuinely derivable or truly the
human's to decide is partly a text-and-queue-state phenomenon the trace does not fully show, so this law
leans on the net-meter and the human review window and reds only on a clear-cut case.
