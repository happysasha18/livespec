"""Stop-hook: catch the offering-hedge frame in outgoing chat (SPEC INV-238).

An offering-hedge is a sentence that offers to do a thing the seat could already derive and could
already reverse through git, holding the offer open for a cue — "just say the word", "let me know
if you want me to" — instead of doing the thing and reporting it done. This is the machine for the
standing no-only-say-hedge behaviour and its deferral chat-hedge sibling [profile
proactivity.no-only-say-hedge, base rule 29, INV-152].

Modeled exactly on the scissors scan (hooks/scissors-scan.py, SPEC INV-173): canonical pack copy,
universal tier only, ships an inline English pattern list. A host's own extra patterns (another
language, a narrower personal rule) never live here — they load from an optional overlay file
`~/.claude/hooks/hedge-personal.json` (a JSON list of regex strings), owned by the personal layer;
this file never creates or edits that overlay. Missing or malformed overlay falls back to
universal-only, silently.

Reads the last assistant turn from the transcript and scans it for the hedge markers. A line
demonstrated inside «guillemets», "double quotes", or `backticks`, and any line inside a fenced
``` code block, is stripped before matching — quoting the banned frame to talk ABOUT it is not
itself a live instance of it. A surviving match BLOCKS the stop with a rewrite instruction.

The gate stands clear of a genuine taste, policy, or irreversible question that names its
human-only fact [INV-152]: that question is the seat's honest admission that the call is not its
own, a shape distinct from an offer to do a call that already is its own.

This net is a FIRST cheap filter on common high-confidence hedge frames, not the whole class. A
paraphrase it does not list slips through, the way the scissors scan's literal list trails one
escape behind the next word [INV-173, INV-203]. The class itself — a hedge in any phrasing, judged
against whether the act was actually derivable — is held by the bucket-1 conduct judge that reads
the turn's action trace, not by this literal net. And this is a Stop-hook notice: the reply is
already emitted when it fires, so it flags the previous reply and asks for a rewrite that reaches
the human one message later, the same one-turn floor the answer-first arm carries [INV-220].
