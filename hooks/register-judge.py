"""register-judge.py — the CHAT surface's register judge (ROADMAP row 416, SPEC INV-203).

The chat arm of the one judge (the mechanism lives in register_judge_core.py). It reads the outgoing
text and hands it, with the chat law, to the cheapest tier, taking back the sentences that carry no
information. The literal overlay beside this file (scissors-personal.json) covers the phrases someone
thought of; a list cannot cover a class, so four empty intensifiers passed the 22-pattern list untouched
when probed 2026-07-17. This judge holds the class the list cannot.

The law it reads is SPLIT (SPEC INV-173): the UNIVERSAL law (naming a thing by denying its neighbour —
the scissors frame) ships with the pack in register_judge_core.py; the PERSONAL laws (empty intensifier,
grading the reader's remark) ride an overlay the personal layer owns
(~/.claude/hooks/register-judge-personal.md), so the pack ships nobody's personal rules. A missing
overlay falls back to universal-only, silently.

Contract: reads a Stop-hook payload on stdin, writes a Stop-hook JSON decision on stdout, exits 0. It
NEVER blocks on its own failure — a judge that cannot reach a model, or answers slowly, or answers in a
shape this script cannot read, stands down and says so on stderr, never blocking on its own breakage.
