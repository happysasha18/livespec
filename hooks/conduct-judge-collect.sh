# The conduct judge's asynchronous half — the Stop arm (SPEC INV-241). Mirrors register-judge-collect.sh
# exactly, but writes a DISTINCT per-session verdict slot (<session>.conduct.json) so a turn that trips
# BOTH judges never has one verdict overwrite the other.
#
# The judge reads meaning, so it costs a model call (~33s, almost all of it the harness's own process
# start). Waiting for it at the end of every turn would tax the human that long per reply to correct acts
# already committed, and a tax that size gets a guard torn out. So the cost is moved off the waiting path:
# this arm hands the turn's ACTION TRACE to the judge in the BACKGROUND and returns at once, blocking
# nothing. The verdict lands in the .conduct.json slot; the UserPromptSubmit arm (conduct-judge-report.sh)
# reads it at the human's next message and puts the finding in front of the model then. A finished turn
# cannot be recalled, so the behavioural correction arrives one turn later by design.
#
# Opt-in and OFF by default: a host turns the conduct judge on by adding this arm (and the report arm) to
# their OWN settings.json. It is a library hook, not wired by the pack.
