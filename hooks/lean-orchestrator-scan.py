"""Stop-hook: warn a session that hoards raw file content inline without dispatching a worker (SPEC INV-246).

The lean-orchestrator law asks the seat to delegate reads and drafts by default — the heavy reading lands
in a worker's own context, not the orchestrator's, so the orchestrator's window stays lean. It is one of
the standing orchestration laws (conduct-law.md), and it stood with no mechanical net, so orchestrator
context kept leaking [profile proactivity, the lean-orchestrator rule]. This arm is that net: a SOFT signal
that measures the raw file content the seat holds INLINE across the SESSION and warns past a threshold when
no worker dispatch accompanies the reading.

WHAT IT MEASURES — inline raw file content, held without a dispatch:
  - INLINE RAW FILE CONTENT is the byte size of the tool_result content for a file-dump call the seat made
    in its OWN main-thread turn: a Read (always a file dump), or a Bash file-dump command (cat / head /
    tail / less / more / sed reading a file). A read made INSIDE a worker is recorded on a sidechain, which
    is the worker's own context — never the orchestrator's — so a sidechain result is never counted.
  - A DISPATCH is an Agent or Task tool_use in the main thread: the seat handing a unit of work to a
    worker. When the seat dispatches, the reading it delegated lands in the worker's context, off the
    orchestrator's window.
  - The arm reads the WHOLE SESSION transcript, not just the last assistant message. A Stop hook reads only
    the last message by default (JOURNAL 2026-07-08), so a per-turn text scan never sees content hoarded
    across a long agentic turn; the leak this net catches lives in the accumulated action trace, so it
    reuses the conduct judge's transcript-reading mechanism [INV-241] and sums across every turn.

THE SIGNAL fires (a block+suppressOutput Stop decision, the soft-signal shape the hedge scan carries
[INV-238]) when cumulative inline raw content is at or over the threshold AND the dispatch count is zero.
The dispatch-count-zero gate is the honest false-positive floor: a session that spawned even one worker is
demonstrably delegating, so the soft signal steps aside rather than second-guess the mix — the same
conservative stance the answer-first arm takes [INV-220]. It catches the pure-hoard case the rule actually
names (the seat does all the reading itself and never dispatches) and is honest that a mixed session slips
by, the way the hedge scan's literal net trails the class [INV-203]. The net naturally CLEARS the moment the
seat dispatches its first worker.

THRESHOLD — a tunable parameter, not a law [SPEC INV-70]. The default is 50 KB of cumulative inline raw
content (~600-800 lines): well past a glance or a single small config read, the point where the seat has
clearly pulled substantial raw material into its own window that a worker should have held. A host tunes it
through an optional overlay `~/.claude/hooks/lean-orchestrator-personal.json`, a JSON object with a
`threshold_bytes` integer, owned by the personal layer; this file never creates or edits that overlay.
Missing or malformed overlay falls back to the built-in default, silently (the hedge overlay contract
[INV-238]).

OFF BY DEFAULT, opt-in. Like the conduct judge [INV-241] and the rest of the orchestration-law family, this
net ships classified in `guardrails/judge-hooks.json` but is NOT wired into the pack's default settings.json
— a host turns it on by adding it to their own Stop array. Not every host runs a delegating orchestrator, so
it is the host's to enable. Its runs and fires are read by the net-meter [INV-202] rather than trusted.

It NEVER blocks on its own breakage: an unreadable payload or transcript stands it down silently, never a
false fire. Repo home: hooks/lean-orchestrator-scan.py; installed copy: ~/.claude/hooks/.
