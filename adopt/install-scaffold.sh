# adopt/install-scaffold.sh — the turnkey scaffold-adoption kit (SPEC INV-97).
#
# Run from a HOST repo root. Vendors the pack's four project-side checks — completeness,
# tests-present, behaviour-traces-to-spec, conflicts — plus their shared library and README into the
# host tree, and seeds the host's guardrails config from the example (only when the host has none — a
# filled config is never clobbered). It writes or MERGES the ratchet manifest (scripts/ratchet-manifest.json):
# a source pin per vendored check (pack version + content hash) so the daily update check can tell a
# current copy from a stale one (SPEC INV-177). A host that already ran the ratchet installer keeps its
# ratchet entries untouched — the two installers share the one manifest.
#
# The manifest keys are the pack-relative source paths (scaffold/guardrails/<name>): the update watcher
# resolves each key against the pack checkout to read the current source and diff its hash, and the
# pack's own copy of these checks lives only under scaffold/guardrails/.
#
# Usage: adopt/install-scaffold.sh [--force]
#   --force    overwrite an already-vendored check file (default: skip an existing file and note it).
#              Never overwrites the host's own guardrails.config.json — that carries the host's paths.
