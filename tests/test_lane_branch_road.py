"""The lane's branch-and-merge road (SPEC E-34, T-23, INV-198..201; ROADMAP rows 386, 412).

A lane's isolated copy is a git worktree holding a branch of its own, cut from the claim
commit on main, penless while it rolls, landed by fast-forward from a rebased branch, and
torn down at its landing.

Two kinds of fact live here and they get two honest treatments.

The document law — the branch's name, the walk's order, the pen's reach, the vendored line —
is a string assertion against the shipped spec, live-spec's own rendered rung.

The road's central claim is a different animal: INV-198 says git ITSELF refuses another
worktree's attempt to move a branch a tree holds checked out, which is why "holding the pen
is the sole right to move main" needs no gate the pack writes. That claim is about a real
engine's runtime behaviour, and no string assertion against a shipped file can see it — the
spec's sentence would read exactly the same on the day git stopped refusing. So those rows
are proven by deed on a real two-worktree repo built in the system temp home (SPEC INV-100:
the suite's own prefix, erased at teardown), and the probe is hermetic — the user's global
and system git config are switched off, so the run reads git's defaults rather than this
machine's habits (SPEC INV-155).

The boundary is pinned beside the guarantee on purpose. Git's refusal covers the three
porcelain roads an agent walks by habit and leaves named doors open, and a suite that pinned
only the happy three would certify a guarantee wider than the one git actually gives.
