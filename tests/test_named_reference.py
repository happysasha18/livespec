"""The named-reference living-description law (INV-240, M-424) and the earned auto-deposit with its
two user-tells (T-24, M-425).

Both facts are stated as law and homed in their normative surfaces; the BEHAVIOUR each names — that
an agent actually defers and rewrites a description on its next penned run, routes a cross-window
re-question as a fault-birth earned message, auto-deposits on an earned birth, and emits the two
tells — lives on the model and the live status surface no script observes [INV-150, INV-83]. So the
honest test level here is doc-structural: the law stands in the spec, the Formal index, ARCHITECTURE,
and this matrix (the traceability quartet, re-walked by tests/test_traceability.py), and the clauses'
own wording is present. No behavioural test is invented for what a script cannot see.
