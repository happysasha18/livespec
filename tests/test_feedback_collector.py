"""feedback-collector (ROADMAP 321) — the pack's outbound feedback arm, E-30 / T-21 / INV-161.

On a rare, genuinely strong reaction the pack OFFERS (positive consent every time) to draft a short
private "upstream note" to the pack's authors, deposits it into a gitignored ``outbox/``, and never
sends — delivery is the human's own step. Off by default. Distinct from feedback-intake (the inverse
arrow) and from the measurement family (no scoring).

String-level assertions on the shipped files. Landed 2026-07-15."""
