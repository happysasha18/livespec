"""The push walk reads the remote gate's verdict; a red CI is the session's own immediate bug — M-245 (SPEC INV-106, row 228).

Alexander's 2026-07-10 ~11:00 word: why does a mail arrive about a failed deploy the session should have
caught and fixed itself. The law: the push step reads the remote gate's own verdict (the CI run the push
triggered), and a red verdict is the pushing session's own immediate bug, fixed and re-pushed the same
session before the human ever meets it in his mailbox. String rows on the law's two homes plus the
INV-106 anchor and index.
