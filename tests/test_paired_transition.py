"""Both directions of a paired state change get the same craft, or a stated reason they do not — INV-126.

When a surface has a pair of opposite state changes (open/close, enter/exit, expand/collapse, show/hide), a
transition crafted for one direction is a decision about the pair, so the other direction is stated too. The
default is symmetry (the exit mirrors the enter's feel unless a reason is written); a shorter or
deliberately-instant exit is a valid STATED answer. It rides the standard-facet sweep as its own facet, and
because motion feel is the human's own gate an undecidable pair is surfaced to him. The prover flags a pair
with one direction described and the opposite unstated. The temporal twin of INV-125. Homes: the composition
clause, the facet list in spec-author, product-prover's paired-transition check. (Born of tlvphotos's
polaroid room revealed under a soft veil and closed on a hard cut, felt on a real phone, 2026-07-12.)
