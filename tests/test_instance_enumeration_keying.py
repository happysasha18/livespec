"""The general-law-plus-instances family declares enumerate-versus-ride (ROADMAP row 370, SPEC INV-226).

The pack carries several laws shaped as one general duty over concrete instances — the range law
(INV-138), the budget law (INV-41), the facet law (INV-18) — and each decided differently whether its
instances are named in the clause or ride the general duty silently, with the keying declared nowhere
(the 2.5.0 design review, finding 2, 2026-07-17). This row states one class sentence keying the choice on
whether the member set is open-ended or closed and enumerable, and has the three named laws cite it.

This module is the traceability proof: the class sentence stands in its one home, and the three laws each
reference it.

Red-first: against HEAD 573d8ea the spec carries no INV-226 and the three laws carry no citation to it, so
every assertion below fails — the red recorded in docs/prover/2026-07-18-rows-370-394.md.
