"""The register judge holds the class a literal list cannot (ROADMAP rows 416+418, SPEC INV-203).

A register law that names a CLASS is held by a model that reads meaning; a list of literal patterns holds
only the instances someone thought of. This module red-proves both surfaces of that law:

  - CHAT (416): four empty intensifiers pass the literal scissors list untouched, and the judge reds them.
    A flat informative sentence passes both. A turn holding many messages is gathered whole, so an offence
    in an early inter-tool message reds — the PLACE fix as well as the KIND fix.
  - DOCUMENT (418): a Russian fixture carrying pack coinages as calques passes the literal preshow list,
    and the judge reds it.

The judge makes a live model call, so nothing here depends on a live `claude` binary. The mechanism's
PARSE / VALIDATE / DECISION logic is driven against canned model responses; the stand-down is driven by
faking a missing binary; the literal-list passes are real and deterministic.

Red-first: before hooks/register_judge_core.py exists, this module fails to import — that is the red.
