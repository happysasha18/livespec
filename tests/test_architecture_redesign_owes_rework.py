"""A deliberate architecture redesign re-shapes and re-proves ARCHITECTURE.md in the same movement — M-252 (SPEC INV-113, row 257).

The tlvphotos window's word, 2026-07-11 ~23:11: a second-finger bug (a moving finger dragged the
underlying room layer into view in the polaroid side room, the resting-finger fix having opened the
window for it) led Alexander to order a rethink of the UI-layer architecture plus a spec update, and he
asked whether the pack already forces the document rework in that case. The honest answer was only
partly: build-pipeline step 3 updates the doc from the spec and the refactor line updates its pins, but
after a real restacking the old document's own shape lies even with fresh pins. The law: when structure
is deliberately redesigned (layers restacked, a surface's ownership moved, nodes merged or split) the
architecture document is re-shaped to the new form and re-proven with the architecture lens in the same
movement; the pins-only path is scoped to a boundary shift that leaves the shape standing. String rows
on the law's two prose homes plus the spec anchor and its index row.
