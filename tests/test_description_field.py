"""The Formal-index non-empty description-field gate (SPEC INV-239, M-421; E-35/INV-239, M-423).

The named-reference pair gives every registered code a plain one-sentence description, and that
description's one home is a dedicated field the Formal index gains [E-35, base rule 4]. This suite
covers the mechanical presence net over that field — `guardrails/check-description-field.py` — and
the field's own existence in the shipped index.

Two facts sit under one owning test file, as the matrix rows say (M-421 the gate, M-423 the field):
the gate reds a registered code whose description field is empty and passes one that carries a
description, judging PRESENCE alone and never whether the description reads well or matches the item
(that semantic read is the human sampling net, INV-41); and it ships DORMANT — the existing code set
carries no rich descriptions yet (the back-describe migration is a future his-gated landing, INV-217,
folded finding N5), so an armed gate would red the whole tree, and the gate stays down until the
migration arms it through `guardrails/description-field.json`.

Every armed/dormant case drives the real shipped script over a FIXTURE Formal-index snippet and a
FIXTURE config, so the real `guardrails/description-field.json` is never flipped and the real tree
stays green under the dormant ship.
