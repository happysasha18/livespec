"""Every landed queue row carries its delegation accounting, and a suite check reads the queue — M-241 (SPEC INV-103, row 254).

His 2026-07-12 ~00:27 word: a landed row's status cell records its delegation — what went to a worker
with a rough saving, or a stood-down line naming why the senior kept the work; the duty binds the
orchestrator seat whatever model leads. Prose alone did not hold the routing rule until he asked what
stops the glitch. Beyond the string needles on the law's two homes, the ROADMAP scan is the mechanical
check itself: every row landed 2026-07-12 or later must carry the line.
