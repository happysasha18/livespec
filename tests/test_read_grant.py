"""A remote consumer of a private contract has no read grant (SPEC INV-232, ROADMAP 389, LAW arm).

The defect (the 2026-07-17 audit's finding 8): INV-187 sends a remote consumer to read the contract
"over git when remote" and cites [INV-112], whose home defines only a PUSH grant on the deposit path;
no READ grant is defined anywhere. tlvphotos is a private repo and the promoter↔site pair is the
expected first real consumer [row 385], so the first contract read across machines has no stated road.

This lands the LAW arm: the remote-seat law grows its read arm — what a consumer needs to read a
private repo over git, WHERE the grant is recorded (the host profile, beside the push grant [INV-82]),
and the honest grantless failure that NAMES the grant it lacks [INV-67]. The real cross-machine read is
field-gated (tied to rows 385/247) and not attempted here.

The tests drive fixture grant records — no repo is cloned.
