"""Delivery separability along a declared composition axis — M-433 (SPEC INV-248, ROADMAP 438).

The dual of the composition-axes law (INV-244). Composition reads whether a surface's BEHAVIOUR
splits along a cross-cutting axis its kind owes; its dual reads whether the delivered ARTIFACT splits
along that same axis or ships as one monolith. When a spec declares such an axis and covering it adds
runtime code, the design carries one of two decided sentences — the axis ships whole for a named
architectural reason (one bundle, one page never torn down, a no-server delivery, a payload too small
to split), or it owes a delivery road a later row lands (a platform split, a lazy load). The finding
is the unexamined third case: an axis adding runtime code that ships as one artifact and names neither.
The lens stays a senior read the prover carries rather than a gate, since a named-reason monolith is
lawful. product-prover carries the lens body and a standing discovery habit — for a lens it applies it
may ask whether that lens's dual bites — held as a habit, never a law that every lens ship paired.

This file proves the law's homes: the SPEC clause and Formal-index row, the product-prover lens body
and its dual-discovery habit, spec-author's duty to state the delivery answer, and the owning
spec-author node in ARCHITECTURE (the lens carried by product-prover). Against HEAD 4dd3857 (pre-delta)
none of these exist — recorded in the station's red run.
