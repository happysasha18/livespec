"""Every person-facing scenario heading carries its feature tag — INV-132 (row 283, prover F4),
re-aimed at the requirements format (row 445, pass 2).

The convention moved with the format: a scenario is a `## Requirement N: ...` heading (H2) carrying a
trailing `[feature: F-x]` tag; an untagged requirement is machinery or reference, and the old
`[not a scenario]` marker retired with the prose shape (the pass-2 intro states the convention: "a
requirement whose heading carries a `[feature: F-...]` tag is a person-facing scenario"). The
forgotten-tag net is two-layered now:
  - every F-code lives ONLY on a `## Requirement` heading (the wave's F6 rule: no F-code rides a
    criterion or User Story bracket) — checked mechanically here, since a tag that slid into a body
    bracket is exactly a forgotten heading tag;
  - a promised feature with no tagged heading reds in the feature-coverage two-way trace
    (test_traceability::TestFeatureCoverage, reading ARCHITECTURE.md's coverage table) — the
    successor of the old H3 tag-or-marker sweep, named as this file's replacement pair.

KNOWN RED, kept deliberately: the spec's own INV-132 criteria (R224.3/R224.4) still say "third-level
heading ... or a not-a-scenario marker" — the pre-format convention — contradicting the intro and the
document's practice (tags on H2, no markers, every H3 a uniform `### Acceptance Criteria`). That
wording is a conversion leftover; test_spec_criteria_match_the_practiced_convention below stays red
until the spec author reconciles R224, and REPIN-LOG.md carries the defect's story.
