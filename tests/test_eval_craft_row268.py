"""Eval-craft follow-ups from the 2026-07-12 skill-evals re-run — row 268.

S1: communicator's INV-27 pipeline-station criterion scored PARTIAL a third re-run; it earns an owner —
a dated decision that the plain-words form is acceptable and the literal station handle is optional.
S2: build-pipeline's delegation-brief PARTIAL persisted because the scenario only brushes delegation;
the fix is a delegation-forcing scenario variant on the eval. (N1's floor folds are prose in three eval
files; this guards the two structural additions.)
