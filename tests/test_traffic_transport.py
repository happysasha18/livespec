"""Which transport carries a message between two agents is decided by the traffic's kind
(SPEC INV-236, ROADMAP 396).

INV-183's transport sentence was written on a refused premise: that git is the universal
transport for all inter-agent traffic and co-location only a fast path. The owner refused it
2026-07-17 — the cut runs by the traffic's KIND. A message needing no timely answer (a durable
record a neighbour reads on its own clock, or a notification) travels by the store: one file the
sender deposits and the receiver sweeps later, reachable while the receiver is not running, the
road that works today [ROADMAP 247]. A conversation — a back-and-forth needing a live peer that
answers in turn — needs a direct channel, and the harness has not shipped one: the socket
plumbing is built and switched off, no listener has shipped [INV-231], so two local sessions have
no live direct channel today.

The router's availability read for the conversation road is FIELD-GATED on the same machine-fact
the listener tripwire reads [INV-231]: a session record carrying a non-empty socket field is a
listener, and today's listenerless harness leaves the direct channel unavailable. The tests drive
FIXTURE records through the router, never a live listener simulated as real; the road's
availability is read from the records rather than hardcoded, so a fixture listener flips it to
available — the proof it is machine-read.
