"""A norm-pointered clause owes a norm-conformance matrix row — M-227 (SPEC INV-43, row 216).

Born of the onboarding card's bounce, 2026-07-10 ~10:15: the first render invented its own row
format, dropped three norm sections, and shipped green — no derivation rule demanded a row
checking the render against the frozen norm. The law lands in test-author's derivation rules
(the matrix half); build-pipeline's code step already carries the norm-open + diff-line half.
