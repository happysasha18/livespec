"""INV-157, INV-158 — the browser test harness launches muted, reaps the whole
process group of the browser it spawned, and bounds each command with a real
per-command deadline; and it has one canonical home, shipped once by the pack as
a template (templates/headless_harness.py) rather than a copy each project
maintains alone. This guard asserts on the SHIPPED files at the string level: the
template is the generic core (no project-specific methods), it carries the mute
flag, the process-group reap, and the per-command deadline; test-author states
the rule; the spec states the two invariants.

The token assertions run against a STRIPPED view of the template — the module
docstring and every comment removed (``_stripped_code`` / ``_func_code``) — so a
token that lives only in prose can no longer satisfy the net: removing the real
construct turns the guard RED even while the docstring still mentions it. Landed
