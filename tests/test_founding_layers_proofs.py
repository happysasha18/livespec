"""A project.kind founding declares its concrete layers AND proof kinds — M-276 (SPEC INV-135, row 292).

P0k of the architect draft: the entry impact read, the footprint categories, and the test ladder are
kind-ABSTRACT stations. Each project kind fills them with its own concrete layers and its own concrete
proof kinds — a photo site decomposes and proves nothing like a codebase. The pack states the abstract
station once; a project's founding declares its concrete fill, recorded in the host profile beside
`project.kind` (SPEC INV-36). A founding check reds a profile that records a kind with no declared layers
and no declared proofs, the way an unbacked surface is flagged at adoption.

The check is red-proven against three real hosts as fixtures — a code/music kind (track-coach), a photo
kind (tlvphotos), a prose kind (the promotion campaign) — each with its own layers and proofs, plus a
kind-only profile that must go red.
