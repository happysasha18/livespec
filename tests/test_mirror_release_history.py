"""The release-history stamp: every mirror's README carries the pack's own version story.

scripts/sync-mirrors.sh rebuilds standalone mirror repos from skills/<name>/ and already stamps
an attribution line (SPEC INV-96) on each mirror's README.md and SKILL.md. This adds a second,
richer stamp: a generated "## Release history" section, computed once from the PACK's own git
log (never hand-written, never stale) and appended to the mirror's README.md only — right before
the attribution line, which stays the last thing in the file. A --print-release-history mode
prints just that section and exits without touching any repo, so the generation logic is testable
without cloning a mirror or reaching GitHub.
