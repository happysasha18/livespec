"""A project.kind founding declares the COMPOSITION AXES it owes every surface — M-429 (SPEC INV-244).

Beside its concrete layers and proof kinds (INV-135) and its design principles (INV-136), a project
kind declares the composition axes it owes every surface beyond the kind-independent C-1 floor — the
further axes a surface answers because its kind renders under them. The founding records the kind's axis
set on a `project.axes` line in the host profile, and the founding check reds a kind recorded with no
axis-set declaration at all, the same rank a kind recorded with no layers or proofs carries [INV-135,
A-10]. A kind may declare **none beyond the floor** as an explicit stated decision — the empty case the
per-kind design-principles set already legitimises for a kind with no visitor-facing surface [INV-136].
The check reds on SILENCE and passes on an explicit "none": because an explicit "none beyond the C-1
floor" line IS present text, a line-anchored presence check naturally reds only true silence.

Two things this file proves, kept distinct:

  1. The completeness check — a presence-check on the `project.axes:` line, mirroring INV-135's
     `founding_complete` (which lives inside `tests/test_founding_layers_proofs.py`, NOT a production
     guardrail). It reds a kind-only profile and passes both an explicit axis set and an explicit
     "none". This logic is self-contained here; the fixtures below are its red-and-pass proof.

  2. The law's homes — the SPEC clause and Formal-index row, the ARCHITECTURE per-kind axis table (all
     seven project.kind rows), the live host profile's own `project.axes` line, spec-author's duty to
     read the declared axes before composing, the founding-question set's axes entry, and ADOPT's
     founding record. Against HEAD (pre-delta) none of these exist; the tests pointing at the still-
     unwired production surfaces (spec-author, founding-questions.json, ADOPT.md) red on the CURRENT
     tree, and the rest red against HEAD — recorded in the station's red run.

NOTE on the founding-questions.json mechanism: `scripts/founding-questions.json` feeds the INV-227
update check (`scripts/check-pack-update.sh`), which NAMES a never-answered question to a host on an
older `founding.set-version` — it is version arithmetic, not a presence-check on `project.axes`. So the
axes entry there serves the update check's "name the new question" duty; the RED-on-silence behavior is
the presence check above. The two are separate mechanisms.
