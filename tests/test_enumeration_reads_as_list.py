"""Enumerable facts earn bullet structure — a prose paragraph packing an enumeration reads as a list.

SPEC INV-215 (ROADMAP row 379). The owner, 2026-07-17, reading the promoter's inter-agent design doc:
a single paragraph packed a filename rule, a collision law, three header fields, and four body parts;
that is a list the reader should meet as a list, the human language already right and the fine-tuning
reading efficiency. The verdict is honest: this stays a STATED writing rule in spec-author's structure
guidance, read by eye and by the prover's cognitive-load lens — it earns NO mechanical lint of its own,
because a regex flagging every three-comma sentence would trip on ordinary rhetorical triads, and telling
a genuine list-owed enumeration from a rhetorical triad is a meaning call no regex makes.

These are string-level checks against the shipped docs: the rule stands in its two homes (spec-author,
the prover's cognitive-load lens), the spec states the law with its Formal-index row, the architecture
assigns it to the spec-author node, the matrix covers it, and the verdict (a stated rule, not a new
pre-push gate) is written where a reader meets it.
