"""A withdrawn decision converges — after two withdrawals the recommended option is taken as a surfaced
[default]. INV-130 (row 285, prover F6).

An answered question closes forever [INV-59], but a withdrawn decision re-asks "in plainer terms" [INV-9]
with no cap, so a genuine taste call could loop unbounded. The fix bounds it: after the SECOND withdrawal of
the same decision the session takes the recommended option as a `[default]` surfaced in the landing report
(silence stays consent, INV-31), the same convergence an answered question already has. Homes: the
decision-page clause + Formal index, and communicator's rule 10. String level, matrix M-271.
