"""The convergence principle stated once — matrix row M-234 (SPEC INV-98, row 218).

His 2026-07-10 ~10:24 word: convergence covers every process and every kind of artifact —
there is a goal, and the work walks toward it, always. The goal is an artifact the work is
held against; a paraphrase cannot serve; iterations measure distance to the goal itself;
reached levels lock by mechanism; divergence only as a named, bounded phase. String rows on
the two homes: the spec clause and the base rulebook (the playbook chapter is machine-local,
verified by deed at its own repo).
