"""INV-157's third net — a tracked script that drives a real headless browser must launch it MUTED.

The pack's own two nets for INV-157 (the shipped template's string-check, the consumer's by-deed
process-group diff) never HEAR a divergent fork's sound: a project that hand-rolls or forks its own
browser launch instead of adopting `templates/headless_harness.py` [INV-158] can play audio during a
test run and neither net catches it — tlvphotos did exactly this. The third net is a guardrail,
`guardrails/check-muted-launch.sh`, that reds a file whose CODE carries both a browser-LAUNCH signal
(`--headless`, `--remote-debugging-port`, `puppeteer.launch`, `chromium.launch`) and a code INVOCATION
token (`subprocess`, `Popen`, `.launch(`, and kin) with no `mute-audio` anywhere in that code. The check
is FILE-level, not per-line, because a real launch's arg list often spans multiple lines; it reads the
comment-stripped code on both the launch and the mute side, so a mute flag named only in a comment cannot
satisfy it, and a docstring that merely NAMES a flag with no real invocation is not flagged.

These tests assert the guardrail exists, passes the clean repo, reds a planted unmuted launch (red-first)
including a multi-line arg list, lets a muted launch and a launch-free file through, and — the two
regressions the fresh-eyes audit found — reds a launch whose only mute flag sits in a COMMENT, and passes
a file that only NAMES the flags in a docstring with no invocation. And that the spec states the net."""

# --- F5 (2026-07-16 batch audit, row 356): the extensionless-shebang scope hole -------------------
#
# The default (no-arg) scan selects files with `git ls-files '*.sh' '*.py' ... 'scripts/*'` — an
# extension allowlist. A tracked, extensionless, shebang-first-line script OUTSIDE scripts/ (a real
# executable, e.g. `bin/serve`) matches none of those patterns and was never read by the scan, so it
# could drive a real headless browser unmuted with the gate staying green. `_scan()` above can't
# exercise this: it hands the guardrail a single-file target, which bypasses the git-ls-files
# extension gate entirely regardless of extension. These tests build a real throwaway git tree (the
# pattern in tests/test_guardrails.py) and run the guardrail with NO target, so it takes the same
# default/no-arg path the push gate uses.
