"""INV-219 (M-400, ROADMAP 387) — the card's gate and adoption's line.

INV-184 declared that a host tree carrying no `.live-spec/agent.md` card is flagged where its
siblings are flagged (beside the project kind [INV-36] and the declared layers [INV-135]), and
that the mechanical gate reading a tree for its card rode ROADMAP row 387 [target] — the law's
net until then being the prover's station. A declared law with no net ranks as a broken
invariant [INV-101], so the [target] stood.

This movement builds that gate — `guardrails/check-agent-card.py`, the sibling of the
kind-with-no-layers flag [A-10] — and names the card in adoption's own document `adopt/ADOPT.md`
so a pre-law tree writes its card at its catch-up [A-11], the duty binding forward [INV-159].
The pack itself is a host [INV-97], and carries its own card at `.live-spec/agent.md`, so the
gate reads this tree and passes. With the gate live, INV-184's [target] comes off.

Every check here asserts the SHIPPED files on disk.
