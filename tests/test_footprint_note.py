"""Every landed feature-or-refactor row carries its footprint note, and a suite check reads the queue — M-275 (SPEC INV-134, row 291).

INV-128 (row 259) states the three-source footprint read and defers the mechanical enforcement to the
follow-on rows. This is that enforcement — the mechanical floor under the footprint read, built to the
same shape the delegation-accounting check (INV-103) gives the routing rule. Beyond the string needles on
the law's homes, the ROADMAP scan is the check itself: a feature-or-refactor row landed once the
impact-analysis station was law (2026-07-12 ~17:01, when INV-128 landed) must carry a `footprint:` note.
Rows that landed before the read was law stay as they landed.
