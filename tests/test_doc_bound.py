"""Growable-artifact bound — every growable working doc declares the number that bounds it and the
watcher that reads it (SPEC INV-234, ROADMAP row 392, the growth-law family).

INV-41 states the shape: a budget plus the watcher that reds past it. This lifts it to every growable
artifact: the four large working docs (PRODUCT_SPEC.md, ROADMAP.md, TEST_MATRIX.md, JOURNAL.md) each
declare a byte ceiling with a recorded reason in `guardrails/doc-bounds.json`, and the watcher
`guardrails/check-doc-bound.py` (gate z, in the push chain) reds a doc past its bound with no fresh
rotation and no raised bound. It COMPOSES with the doc-rotation gate (gate t, INV-209): crossing the
bound earns a rotation, and the rotation is the remedy the red points to — a doc rotated today passes.

Caution held: each declared bound sits ABOVE the current file, so this very push does not red on the four
already-large docs; the ratchet points down (rotation resets the live file well under the ceiling).

Red-first: run against the pre-delta tree and the watcher and its bounds file are absent, the push chain
unwired, and spec/index/architecture/matrix carry no INV-234.
