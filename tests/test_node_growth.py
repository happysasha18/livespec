"""Node growth — a node's fitness is re-answered as it grows, and node co-residence in one file is
the counted signal (SPEC INV-233, ROADMAP row 390, the growth-law family).

The three-question fitness test [INV-122] governs a node's BIRTH; a node born right and then grown
carries a standing yes nobody re-reads. So co-residence — two nodes whose pins share one file — is the
mechanical face of a failed growth answer, read from the architecture's own pin column. The counter
`guardrails/node_growth_counter.py` reads nodes-per-file and reds any file that rose past its ratchet;
the ratchet `guardrails/node-file-cap.json` is seeded at the tree's current count so the tree lands green,
standing debt flagged, and ratchets DOWN only [INV-164's lesson transfers whole].

This ratchet RIDES THE SUITE (like the prose-debt cap, tests/test_convergence_locks.py) — it takes no
push-gate letter, so these tests assert it is NOT wired into the push chain. Two prose homes carry the
law's review duties: product-prover's seventh architecture lens (the growth re-ask) and the
design-reviewer's split-proposal shape.

Red-first: run against the pre-delta tree and the counter/cap are absent, the prover carries no seventh
lens, the design review no split-proposal shape, and spec/index/architecture/matrix carry no INV-233.
