"""INV-211 — the chat judges stay wired in settings.json (gate v, ROADMAP 420 candidate 2).

config-health (gate m) proves an installed hook FILE matches its source, and hands this residual
to the row 420 audit by name: it does not prove settings.json still LISTS the judge entries. A
judge whose file is present still never runs when its settings.json entry is gone — the run comes
from the entry, not the file. That is the no-verdict failure this movement hit. check-judge-listed.py
reads the wired-hook declaration (guardrails/judge-hooks.json), asserts every hook under hooks/ is
classified there, and asserts each wired hook is referenced in its surface's array in the installed
~/.claude/settings.json; where settings.json cannot be read it stands down by name.
