"""The pen tie-break rests on an identity every session owns (SPEC INV-117, row 277).

The parallel-lanes pen tie-break used to break a no-ancestry concurrent claim by the lower
inbox session token, but that token is minted only at an inbox slug collision — a session
that never raced a slug had none. The fix mints a stable per-session identity at session
start, independent of the inbox, and the pen tie-break orders on it.
