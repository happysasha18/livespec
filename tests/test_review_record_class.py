"""The review-record class is declared once (SPEC INV-156, ROADMAP row 323).

The prover record and the design-review record were declared mirror siblings, but the
skill-creator craft-walk record and the verify-by-deed audit — the same kind of pass —
were never named members of a class. INV-156 declares the class once, names every review
pass's record a member, and states verify's deliberate difference (its outcome lands in
the landing record, not a dated file of this class).

Zero dependencies beyond the stdlib; run from the repo root:
  python3 -m pytest -q tests
