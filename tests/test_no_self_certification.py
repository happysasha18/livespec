"""No self-certification of sincerity — matrix row M-223 (SPEC INV-94, row 237).

His 2026-07-10 ~13:53 word, off the README's "we say so plainly": a line that labels its author's
honesty or directness adds no information — naming not-A informs only where not-A was a live
alternative. The rule stands in the spec and the communicator, the register lint's pattern family
grows with the caught phrases, and the pack's own README is swept clean of the class.
