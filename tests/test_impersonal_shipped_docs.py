"""Shipped product docs state each requirement impersonally (SPEC INV-118, row 274).

A shipped product doc — the spec, the test matrix, the README, a skill card — reaches
everyone the project touches. Each requirement reads as three plain parts: the rule, the
actor as a role (the user, the producer, the target user), and the reason it holds. The
reason is load-bearing and stays; the personal attribution drops. A dated decision keeps
the date as a plain anchor and drops the name. Personal attribution and candid process
voice have one home: the local-only diaries (JOURNAL, NEXT_STEPS), which no publish ships.
