"""The four host checks' shipping contract — matrix row M-226 (SPEC INV-97, row 241).

The web session's curator read, 2026-07-10: the pipeline's four teeth (completeness,
tests-present, behaviour-traces-to-spec, conflicts) ship as generic runnable code a host
attaches by ONE config file — honest failure modes, adopt-walk attachment, the pack repo
as the first host. This test pins the CONTRACT's presence; the checks' own function-level
rows land with their code (the row 241 build).
