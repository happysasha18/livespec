"""A decision recorded as the person's names the exchange it came from; a claim the pack reasoned out
is written in the pack's own voice (SPEC INV-207, ROADMAP 415).

Every claim in this pack stands on an artifact a reader can go and check. A human's word is the one
input with no artifact behind it — the one claim no agent, prover, or gate questions — so a
challengeable judgment recorded AS the person's is a fabrication moved into the one slot nothing
reaches again. That is the defect born 2026-07-17, when a session recorded its own lane-ranking as the
person's decision and he recognised nothing on read-back.

Two machines hold the rule:
  * the read-back surface `DECISIONS.md` — the decision-set record, the read-back touchpoint the frame
    declares [INV-205], asynchronous and opened on request — shows the person the decisions the pack
    believes he made, so he strikes what he never said (a struck line retracted, kept with its note);
  * the gate `guardrails/check-authority-anchor.py` reads the decision set: in a declared
    `DECISION-RECORD` surface every live on-record entry carries its date, a struck entry skipped, so
    an unanchored one reds. Its standing scan is the decision-record surface (false-positive-free by
    construction); the spec, base rulebook, and roadmap take the one-time first sweep.

The fabricated lane-ranking is the corpus's first fixture.
