"""The catch-up routing carries its version-delta discriminator — M-248 (SPEC INV-110, row 239).

The track-coach audit (2026-07-10 ~14:19) found the trigger wordings would justify the heavy
catch-up walk where a host queue row is the truth: a pure docs-layout pass with no pack-version
delta fell into the gap. The routing states the discriminator in one sentence — the walk fires
only when the host's recorded package version is behind the current package VERSION — carried in
both homes: the spec's skill-behaviour paragraph and the guide's "When to run this".
