"""Compaction is a scheduled station for code as well as docs, with its second trigger — row 260b (SPEC INV-123).

Milestone DOC compaction already stands (INV-115). This widens the station to CODE — duplicate logic
merges, dead weight leaves with its listing (INV-109), a ripened abstraction is extracted only through
the three-question fitness gate (INV-122) — and gives it a SECOND trigger: apart from the milestone, the
second occurrence of the same problem (base rule 19) fires it. Each pass locks the reached level with a
test or a lint (the convergence law, rows 216-218 / INV-98). Homes: the milestone-rhythm compaction
section + build-pipeline's before-a-MINOR gate.
