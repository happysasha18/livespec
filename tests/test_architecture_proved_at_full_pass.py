"""The full pass proves the architecture beside the spec (SPEC INV-116, row 271).

Every milestone gate [M-1] and every push gate [M-6] runs the product-prover over
ARCHITECTURE.md as well as PRODUCT_SPEC.md, so the design-level seams meet the same
structured review the spec gets. The taste call: commit-time freshness only, no content-grep
— the guardrail side of this (tests/test_guardrails.py) proves the freshness mechanics; this
file proves the spec says so.
