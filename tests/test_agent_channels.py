"""When agents work together — the agent/skill boundary, the two channels, the card and the
scan, the published contract, the earned message, and the birth walk.

Matrix rows M-352..M-368, derived from the spec's `## When agents work together` section through
ARCHITECTURE.md's node table: base-rulebook (E-31, INV-182, INV-183, INV-188, INV-189, INV-190,
INV-191, INV-193, INV-194), spec-author (E-33, INV-185, INV-186, INV-187), host-contract (E-32,
INV-184), inbox (INV-192), build-pipeline (T-22).

Levels, in this repo's declared four-rung vocabulary (the matrix header's recorded interpretation;
the closed set is enforced at tests/test_traceability.py): the pack ships documents, so a law's
rendered level is a `string` assertion against the SHIPPED file on disk. Two rows here go past a
document read and exercise a real artifact, the way the guardrail rows M-229..M-231 already do —
`test_gate_passes_a_message_naming_its_blocked_work` / `test_gate_reds_a_message_naming_no_blocked_work`
run `guardrails/check-earned-message.py` against a real fixture deposit and read its exit code both
ways, and `test_pack_card_exists_and_names_its_five_fields` reads this pack's own real card from disk.

The contract's mechanical arms (a producer's permission gate, a consumer's freshness check, a
compatibility test) are NOT asserted here: this pack contains no data producer, so there is nothing
to exercise, and they ship when a host declares its first contract (ROADMAP row 385, [target]). The
rows for E-33, INV-185, INV-186 and INV-187 assert that those laws stand in the documents today.
