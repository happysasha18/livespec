"""The M-1 milestone gate enumerates the design-review pass — SPEC INV-141 (audit D1, 2026-07-14).

INV-141 says the design review "runs in full at every full prover pass", and a milestone runs a full
spec re-prove — so the design review is owed at the milestone. But the enumerated M-1 milestone-gate
step list (the checklist a session actually walks) never named it, so a pure-milestone movement ran the
prover, stood the design review down at the push gate, and skipped it silently with every gate green.
This is the red-first fence: the M-1 list must name the design-review pass, and the architecture's
"Decisions — where they live" append duty must land its dated record beside the prover record.
String level against the shipped docs.
