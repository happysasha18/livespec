"""The leave-command reaches a shutdown-safe stop — matrix row M-224 (SPEC INV-95, row 235).

His 2026-07-10 ~13:30 word from the cafe: one spoken leave-word makes the session wind down —
workers halted or landed (a sleeping machine kills them mid-write), every lane at its checkpoint,
green work committed, and one closing line says the machine is safe to power off plus what
resumes where. String rows on the three homes: the spec clause, the communicator's reporting
rules, and the base checkpoint rule.
