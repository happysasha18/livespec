"""A grown founding question reaches hosts that founded before it (ROADMAP row 394, SPEC INV-227).

When the pack grows its founding-question set, a host that already answered the old set never learns a new
question exists: the update check reads FILES and says nothing about QUESTIONS, so a host founded at an
older set version carries a frozen answer set (the agent card E-32/INV-184 is the live example — every
existing tree predates it). This row versions the founding-question set, records the version a host
answered, and extends the daily update check (scripts/check-pack-update.sh, E-25) with a founding arm that
names each never-answered question beside the stale files the pin arm already reports (INV-177).

Kin of INV-159 (a duty binds forward): a never-answered question is surfaced for the host to answer at
catch-up, answered on no one's behalf.

Red-first: against HEAD 573d8ea there is no scripts/founding-questions.json, the host profile carries no
founding.set-version line, and check-pack-update.sh has no founding arm — so the fixture-host assertions
below fail. The red is recorded in docs/prover/2026-07-18-rows-370-394.md.
