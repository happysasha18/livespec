"""A mid-work re-door rebuilds the parallel-lanes independence graph — INV-131 (row 286, prover F7).

A lane re-doored to feature mid-work (INV-16) can create a surface overlapping a rolling sibling, but the
independence graph (INV-49) was not rebuilt, so the departures board kept asserting "independent" after it
stopped being true. The fix: the mid-work door re-check also re-runs the independence edges against every
rolling lane, and a new edge pulls the re-doored lane back to serial with a board line, so the board never
asserts a stale independence. Homes: the mid-work re-door clause + Formal index, and build-pipeline's door
re-fire. String level, matrix M-272.
