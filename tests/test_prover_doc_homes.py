"""The prover doc's reader-facing homes — outside adversarial review, 2026-07-16.

The frontmatter description carries only the autoload trigger; the prover/design-reviewer
boundary is homed in "When NOT to use" (the modes paragraph points at it); the
paired-transition kind-split lives in its lens, and the KIND block stays general.
Red-proven against the pre-restructure file (HEAD before commit 2cca664)."""
