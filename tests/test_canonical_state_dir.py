"""One canonical state directory; worktree isolation by default on overlap — M-244 (SPEC INV-105, row 227).

The audit found a ghost `.livespec` dir with a different profile beside the real `.live-spec` (two
competing truths), and overlapping write-sets ran unisolated (2026-07-10). The law: the canonical state
directory is named `.live-spec`, once; a near-miss dir found at attach or resume is a red finding retired
to the attic under a manifest line; and worktree isolation is the default when two lanes' write-sets
overlap. String rows on the law's three homes plus the INV-105 anchor and index.
