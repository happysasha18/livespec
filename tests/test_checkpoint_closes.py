"""A landing closes the checkpoints it shipped — M-240 (SPEC INV-107, row 226).

The closing half of the checkpoint law. The audit (2026-07-10) found two engine checkpoints still
reading "not started" after everything in them shipped, so a resuming session would have redone done
work. A landing that ships a checkpoint's items flips that checkpoint to its closed state in the same
landing; a checkpoint whose items all live in git history is stale by definition. String rows on the
law's two homes (the spec breakpoint clause + base rule 6) plus the spec anchor and its index row.
