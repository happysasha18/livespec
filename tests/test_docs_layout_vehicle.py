"""The light vehicle for an owner-scoped docs-layout pass is sanctioned — M-249 (SPEC INV-111, row 240).

The track-coach audit (2026-07-10 ~14:23) found track-coach s63, lacking a named vehicle, correctly
improvised one for a pure docs-layout pass: a checkpoint carrying the owner's locked decisions, work
on a clean pushed base so restore is one command, and a multiset proof that content survived. The
pack now names that shape so hosts neither skip discipline nor over-apply the catch-up machinery.
Two homes: the spec's F-catchup vehicle clause and build-pipeline's docs-only/restructure door.
