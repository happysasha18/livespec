"""INV-179 — the upstream note is anonymized before it leaves the draft.

A host's real entities (names, company, internal repos, paths, customer data) become neutral
role words IN the draft the user reads at consent — so what they approve is exactly what would
travel; a note masked after the yes is a different note from the approved one. Enterprise hosts
are why this is law rather than taste.
