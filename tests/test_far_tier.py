"""The queue has a far tier, and it stands down by name and surfaces itself rarely.

SPEC INV-222 (ROADMAP 382) — a wish kept because discarding it would lose the thought, carrying
no revisit trigger and no plan to run, takes the `far` status, distinct from `deferred` whose
trigger the queue-take re-scans every time [INV-129]; the what's-left report and the feature map
read the runnable queue and stand the far tier down by name, offering it on request.

SPEC INV-223 (ROADMAP 403) — the far backlog surfaces itself rarely and unasked: the status
report carries a rare line naming that a far tier exists, at a settings-ladder cadence default
(at most once every fourteen days) with a dated marker; a second offer inside the window reds.

The checker `guardrails/check-far-tier.py` is report-shape only and is NOT in the pre-push chain
(a chat report is not a committed file a push gate could scan); the suite drives it over fixtures.
