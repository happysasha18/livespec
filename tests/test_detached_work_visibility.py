"""Detached work stays visible — matrix row M-232 (SPEC INV-35 tightened, row 248).

His 2026-07-10 ~17:10 word from the track-coach window: twice a multi-minute background run
went silent and read as lost. A detached operation (a background command or a delegated worker
the chat does not stream) expected past ~2 minutes opens with a start line, keeps a beat every
~2 minutes or per stage, and closes with a done digest. String rows on the two homes: the spec
clause and the communicator skill.
