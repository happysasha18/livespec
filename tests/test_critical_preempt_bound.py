""""Critical" priority heads the queue but never preempts a rolling lane, and the bound is echoed at
intake — INV-133 (row 284, prover F5).

"Critical" is defined in bug terms but liftable onto any door, so a critical non-bug (a violated safety gate
the tripwires route to the feature door) heads the queue and then waits for the current lane — only the bug
door preempts — while a human who said "critical" for a live break expects bug-like preemption. The spec
already states the bound (critical heads the queue whatever its door; only the bug door preempts the in-work
lane); the fix makes it unambiguous and ECHOES it back at intake, so the human hears that his critical
non-bug will head the queue but not stop the rolling lane. Homes: the priority clause + Formal index, and
communicator's capture echo (rule 12). String level, matrix M-274.
