"""INV-170 — a surface add re-verifies the document's quantified claims against the grown set.

A new surface falsifies EXISTING document-level sentences without touching them: a class clause's
member enumeration now silently excludes the newcomer, an "every"/"only"/"all"/"exactly" sentence
ranges over a set that grew, a previously terminal scenario's decided edge may no longer be
terminal. None of these are seams the new surface composes across, so the seam-scoped CROSS-LINK
mode missed them and the whole-doc property sweep it skips is where they would have been caught.
CROSS-LINK now carries the quantifier re-verify as its one mandatory whole-doc step.

These tests assert the spec states the law and the prover skill's CROSS-LINK mode carries it.
