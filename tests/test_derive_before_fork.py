"""Derive from a proven artifact before offering a fork — row 270 (SPEC INV-121).

The read-the-doc twin of ask-never-guess: before surfacing a design choice, a session checks whether an
existing proven artifact (the architecture, the spec, the invariants) already determines the answer;
when it does, it derives the requirement and cites the section, offering no fork. A fork reaches the
human only for what the artifacts leave genuinely open. The law lives in the base rulebook beside
ask-never-guess and in the spec. (Born of a track-coach session that offered the owner two options while
its ARCHITECTURE.md layer split already determined the answer, 2026-07-12.)
