"""The convergence locks hold by test, never by attention (row 217, M-214..216).

Three locks the audit found attention-held, now each held by a test:
frozen norms are content-fingerprinted; the register lint's pattern set only
grows; the debt cap only ratchets downward. Changing any guarded value is
LEGAL only as a deliberate, visible edit to its manifest/floor — in the same
