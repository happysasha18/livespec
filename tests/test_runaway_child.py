"""A finished worker leaves no runaway child that burns unseen (SPEC INV-213, ROADMAP 420 candidate 4).

When a worker or task the run spawned COMPLETES, a descendant it left behind can keep burning a full
core unnoticed — the difflib process that burned one core for forty-six minutes after its worker
reported done, masked by a frozen status line (memory 2026-07-17). The run owns that descendant, so
the run answers for it. At a stopping point the run REPORTS a runaway descendant it provably owns:
what it is, how much CPU it holds, and why the run owns it — the notice word Alexander gave
2026-07-17 ~16:58, the same word that ordered row 417's cleanup notice.

This lives in process space, where a coarse scope does real harm — a broad kill once closed the
owner's real browser (SPEC INV-162). So the check names a runaway ONLY by PROVABLE OWNERSHIP: a
process in the run's OWN process group, or under the run's own temp tree — never by a program name.
It is a NOTICE-first mechanism: it REPORTS through the shared cleanup-notice module and ends nothing.

The tests drive a SIMULATED process table — no runaway is ever spawned on the real machine.
