"""A release's number reports what taking it costs a host, and the minor-versus-major-versus-patch
call is a stated judgment held by no gate (SPEC INV-217, ROADMAP 407).

The owner asked for this guidance on 2026-07-17 ~15:45: he wanted to know when a release earns a
minor bump and when a major one, saying it would be useful, since every release so far had picked
its number by the session's feel with the rule written nowhere. The minor-versus-major call reads
meaning a machine cannot, so the rule stays a stated guidance rather than a blocking gate — a
judgment is never a gate. This is a traceability test that the guidance stands in each of its
homes: the base rulebook a host reads, the spec's formal clause and index, the architecture's
owning node, build-pipeline's release step, and the matrix. Red-proven against the pre-delta tree
(2026-07-18): none of these homes carried the release-tier rule before this landing.
