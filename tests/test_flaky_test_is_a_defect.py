"""INV-155 — a test is green only when it passes deterministically, and a flaky
test whose root is in OWNED code is a defect fixed at that root. This guard
proves the law is carried in all three text homes: the spec's green-means-
deterministic clause with its removable-in-owned-code seam question, the
build-pipeline step-8 green definition, and the test-author determinism rule.
