"""Interface tests and the layer-to-level rule — row 294 (P8+P9, anchored on INV-101).

P8: the test level follows the footprint's layer — a presentation change is asserted at browser-computed
or above, a single-module change at its module's interface, a cross-cutting law by a string/traceability
test across every surface. P9: each module's tests assert its declared INTERFACE (one interface-level row
per architecture-node block), and a cross-cutting law (the declared-laws home, INV-101) gets one test per
surface it governs.

The traceability enforcement extends in two directions, each red-proven on a synthetic fixture:
  (A) a declared law with a surface that has no test row goes red — the same shape as a spec invariant
      with no matrix row;
  (B) a module block with no interface-level row goes red — a derivation defect at the coverage walk.
The real matrix satisfies both (every node block owns an interface row; every declared law is covered),
so the suite stays green while the checks have teeth on a violation.
