"""The drafter-applier pipeline is the standard colliding-rows form — M-242 (SPEC INV-49, row 255).

Born live 2026-07-12: the law batch all touched the spec/matrix/version chain, so landings serialized
under the pen, and the queue still moved at two rows an hour once a drafter worker prepared the next
row's edit strings while the applier landed the current one. String needles on the pipeline's text.
