"""A cleanup says what it ended (SPEC INV-204, ROADMAP 417).

Every process this pack ends is reported with WHAT it was and WHY the run owned it — the PID, the
process group, or the owned path that proves ownership — so an ending nobody expected is visible the
moment it happens rather than at the next unexplained loss. This notice ships AHEAD of INV-162's
stricter form: it shows what the strict check would have refused before the strict check starts
refusing.

Two arms, the same shape as the pack's other nets:
  * a shared notice helper (`guardrails/cleanup_notice.py`) the cleanup paths emit through, and
  * a gate (`guardrails/check-cleanup-notice.sh`) that reds a cleanup path ending a process WITHOUT
    emitting the notice.
The pack's one real cleanup path is the headless harness's process-group reap; it emits the notice.
