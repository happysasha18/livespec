"""The authoring seat does not adversarially certify its own work (ROADMAP row 422, SPEC INV-237).

The 2.7.0 release ran its adversarial prover pass in the same context that authored the release's new
lenses, so it never turned a brand-new lens onto the skill body that introduced it; a fresh web review
then caught a Phase-5 count naming four blocks over five and two bullets packing three rules each. The
rule this module proves: a release's adversarial pass is authored by a fresh seat, and a newly added
lens or rule is self-applied to its own introducing document before release. It generalizes the
fresh-eyes freshness the verify audit already demands (INV-46) and the periodic audit's adversarial
stance (INV-145) to the release pass itself.

Whether a review was truly clean-context is a process fact no gate fully sees, so this is a traceability
proof that the pack's own text STATES the duty across its homes; the optional record gate checks only
that a dated record exists and names a different seat.

Red-first: against origin/main 03a4d26 the spec, Formal index, architecture, matrix, base rulebook, and
the two wiring skills carry no INV-237, so every assertion below fails.
