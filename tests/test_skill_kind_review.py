"""Every skill-kind landing walks skill-creator's review — matrix row M-235 (SPEC INV-99, row 219).

His 2026-07-10 ~10:26 word, raised ~10:29: every skill goes through skill-creator, always — the
work-kind classifier is the trigger. The verify step of a skill-kind wish additionally runs the
installed skill-creator's review of the touched skill; findings fold or get rejected by name in
the landing record. String rows on the two homes: the spec clause and the pipeline's work-kind
table (verify row, skill column).
