# Mini spec

This is a preamble. It states what the codes are: bracket codes like `INV-1` trail each criterion and point to the rule's home. A reader can ignore them.

## Glossary

- **widget** — one unit the product shows to a person.
- **panel** — the surface a widget sits on.

## Requirement 1: A widget shows on its panel

**Context:** The product shows widgets to a person. A person opens a panel. The widget appears on it. The person reads what the widget shows.
