"""Every request enters through a three-source impact read, the footprint decides the route — INV-128 (row 259).

Beside the door and the work-kind, a third dimension is read at intake: the FOOTPRINT, read from the spec
(what behaviour changes), the architecture (which module owns it), and the code (what gets touched). One
named footprint — presentation-only / single-module / cross-cutting — spoken in the capture echo, written in
the row's footprint note. The footprint decides the route (light road / matrix step / full pipeline). Source
disagreement is a finding routed to its owner. It is the verdict derive-before-fork (INV-121) rests on. It
re-classifies mid-work. The station carries the boundary-health law. The entry station (P1-P6) of the
fourteen-principle architect draft. Homes: the intake clause, build-pipeline step zero, ARCHITECTURE's
boundary-health law, product-prover's three-source lens, communicator's capture echo. (Alexander live
