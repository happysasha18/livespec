"""Row 280: communicator's body thinned under the ~500-line ideal without cutting a rule.

Row 266 extracted the writing register to references/ but the body still sat at 565 lines; row 280 is
the follow-on that brings it under ~500 by grouping tighter and spilling the unpinned worked EXAMPLES to
a second references/ file — every one of the 22 rules kept (folded, grouped, or pointered, never cut).

This test is the conservation floor under that refactor. It guards the exact failure the row hit once (an
auto-tighten pass that silently dropped four normative sub-rules) from the other side: the body stays
under the ideal AND every rule tag stays present AND the relocated examples remain reachable in the new
references file. The per-rule NORMATIVE phrases stay pinned by their own feature tests across the suite;
here we hold the structural conservation.
