"""A test's expected value derives independently of the code under test — M-238 (SPEC INV-102, row 224).

His 2026-07-10 ~11:00 word, from row 220's audit (item 3): green suites missed real walk bugs because
tests recomputed the code's own formula as the expected value, so the assertion only proved the code
equal to itself. A test's expected value must come from an independent source — a hand-computed
constant, an independent derivation, or a recorded real output reviewed by a human. String rows on the
law's two homes plus the spec anchor and its index row.
