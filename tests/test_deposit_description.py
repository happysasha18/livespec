"""The agent-channel deposit-time description lint (SPEC INV-239, M-422).

The named-reference pair's new reach is the agent channel: when an agent deposits a `from-<agent>`
inbox file, every internal code it references travels beside its plain one-sentence description, so
the neighbour reads a self-explaining file [E-35, INV-183]. This lint is that reach's mechanical net
— `guardrails/check-deposit-description.py`. It reads the same `from-<agent>` deposits the
earned-message gate reads [INV-189, base rule 30] and reds a referenced internal code that arrives
with no description beside it, naming the code and the file. It judges PRESENCE alone and never the
semantic match, undecidable on a translated or reformulated sentence and owned by the human net
[INV-41, INV-83].

Every case drives the real shipped script over a FIXTURE inbox, so no real deposit is needed and the
real tree (whose inbox carries no agent deposits today) stays green.
