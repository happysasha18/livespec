"""The senior verifies write-set disjointness at brief-time before spawning a second concurrent writer.

The concurrent-edit fence [INV-11] stays silent between same-session sibling workers (fence-benign),
so the reactive net cannot catch two of the orchestrator's OWN helper workers colliding on a shared
file. This law puts the check where the silence forces it: at brief-time, before the second concurrent
writer is spawned, the senior confirms the two briefs' write-sets are disjoint or gives the later worker
an isolated tree. It extends ACT-3 / INV-11 (a spawn-time obligation on the existing "the senior owns
the seams" duty), so it homes on the worker contract and adds no new invariant. Born of a real
two-sibling-worker collision that self-corrected (tlvphotos 2026-07-13).
