"""The stranger door (INV-146) and its monitor (INV-147) — ROADMAP row 261.

M-288 asserts the stranger-arm law lives in its prose homes and the templated door ships.
M-289 asserts the monitor's surfacing logic is a pure, idempotent, crash-safe function,
single-instance by a lock, and honest on an unreachable repo.
M-290 asserts the package repo's scheduled monitor action ships and is single-instance.
M-291 asserts the cross-host coordinator: two hosts on one repo converge on a single
surfacing by a claim on the shared item, arbitrated by a pure winner reading, the claim
stolen by age like the per-host lock, its marker distinct from the surfaced-gen record.
