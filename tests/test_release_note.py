"""A release note may offer the reader appealing next steps for their own choice
(SPEC INV-228, ROADMAP 402).

A GitHub changelog / release note may offer the reader next-step CHOICES — appealing things the
reader may do next, phrased as choices and never instructions. The publish skill's release-note
shape carries the offers section as OPTIONAL, and the publish walk RECORDS the offer-or-none
decision: a release-note record that neither offers a next step nor records "no offer" reds, and one
that offers or records "none" passes.

The touchpoint frame [INV-205] already classifies this surface: the release note is the human-audience,
no-answer-needed kind — an asynchronous, person-opened point (he reads it when he opens the release
notes himself), so an offer (a teaching-adjacent line) is afforded and an interruption is not. This
movement consumes that classification; it does not re-open the frame.

The checker `guardrails/check-release-note.py` reds a record that leaves the offer-or-none decision
unrecorded and passes one that offers or records "none". It rides the suite and NOT the push chain:
the release note the walk produces is a process artifact the walk records at runtime, and no committed
release-note file exists in the tree for a push gate to scan (the sibling of the far-tier report-shape
check, SPEC INV-83).
