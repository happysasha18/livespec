"""INV-167 — a re-enterable surface triggers the prover's standing entry-state lens.

A surface a visitor can leave and re-enter must declare, in the spec, the state that re-entry OPENS IN:
where it lands focused/positioned, and whether entering resets its internal state or resumes the state a
prior visit left. Entry symmetry [INV-50] tests that a re-entry PATH exists; this tests the STATE that
path opens in. Born of a shipped bug: a series side-room reopened on the last picture a prior visit had
scrolled its lane to, instead of the first member, because no line stated the entry state (2026-07-16).

These tests assert the spec states the lens and the product-prover skill carries it, so the standing lens
is real text a reviewer runs by construction rather than a note in a journal."""
