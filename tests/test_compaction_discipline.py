"""The full pass compaction discipline (SPEC INV-115, row 272).

Compact means there is no redundant information: a fact lives once, in one home, with a
pointer from everywhere else that needs it. A pass removes only redundancy and keeps
anything whose removal would change the meaning or a reader's understanding. Compaction is
per-item judgment, kin to the removal-accounting duty (INV-109).
