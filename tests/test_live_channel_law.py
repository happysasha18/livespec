"""The live-channel law: a behavioural rule that breaks mid-turn twice earns a live channel — M-246 (SPEC INV-108, row 256).

His 2026-07-12 ~00:39-00:40 word (why a recurring rule lives in a file read once, and that it must be
written into live-spec) plus the worked proof: the routing rule lived in once-read files since June and
broke mid-turn until the every-prompt hook line and the after-the-fact suite check landed (rows 253/254,
2026-07-12), the same cure that killed invented clock stamps. String rows on the law's two homes plus the
spec anchor and its index row.
