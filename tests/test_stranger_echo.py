"""The stranger arm's echo-and-close law (INV-147/INV-27) — M-337.

M-337 asserts a captured stranger wish is answered on its source too, not just harvested:
the capture echo posted as a comment on the source Issue at harvest, the Issue closed once
its row reaches a terminal exit — extending M-289's no-wish close (a no-wish item is closed
with a recorded note) to the yes-wish case.
