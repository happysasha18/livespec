"""A worker's teardown reaps its own process group (SPEC INV-230, ROADMAP 393).

INV-213 already landed the NOTICE — a report-only mechanism that finds an owned, orphaned, burning
descendant and reports it, ending nothing. This row lands the remaining two arms of the same class:

  1. THE REAP. A worker's teardown reaps its OWN process group — a scoped kill of the process group
     the run itself owns. It is safe because it targets the run's own group, exactly INV-162's
     owned-identity discipline: the reap takes a numeric process group, never a program name, and
     refuses any group it cannot prove the run owns. It reports through the shared cleanup-notice
     shape (row 417, INV-204), so the reap says what it ended.

  2. THE IDLE-OUTPUT DETECTION HABIT. A worker whose status reads "running" while its output file has
     stopped growing is checked by output mtime — the liveness-via-mtime read (INV-76) — so a stalled
     worker is caught rather than left to a frozen status line (the memory instance, 2026-07-17).

The tests drive fakes and a simulated worker table — no process is ever killed on the real machine.
