"""Deferred rows are revisited at every queue-take, not only at milestones — INV-129 (row 282, prover F3).

A deferred row carries a revisit trigger [T-8]; a time-bound one ("before the next release", "when the
campaign ships") can come true and lapse between two milestone gates, so the milestone re-scan [M-1] read
the triggers too rarely. The fix states a second cadence: at every queue-take the session re-scans each
deferred row's revisit trigger, and a fired trigger returns its row to the runnable head [INV-49] right
then — the same triggers read by the same rule at both cadences, so a deferred wish never waits on a
trigger nobody reads [INV-1], whichever comes first. Homes: the queue-take clause + build-pipeline's
queue-take walk. String level, matrix M-270.
