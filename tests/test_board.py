"""The waiting list keeps what waits for his eyes, and nothing on it is ever lost
(SPEC INV-206, ROADMAP 408).

Chat is a display and it scrolls, so a question parked for the person and an answer he never saw both
evaporate. The board — `WAITING.md` at the host root — holds them, and chat renders it. An item clears
on his acknowledgement alone (never auto-expired, which would lose an unread item — his 2026-07-17 ~15:57
correction). The bound governs only the shown set (cap 12); the list and the attic are unbounded. When
the shown set is full and a new item arrives, the oldest shown item demotes into the list whole and
alive, and a superseded or cleared item moves to the attic with a manifest line (base rule 10).

The gate `guardrails/check-board.py` reds three violations: a closing report that omits a still-open
item; a demotion with no matching line (a silent loss); an over-cap shown set. A genuine board passes
quiet.
