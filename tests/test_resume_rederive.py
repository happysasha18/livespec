"""INV-247 — a deferred item's own state is re-derived from the code before its work resumes (ROADMAP 430).

A method discipline with no mechanical gate: these checks assert the SHIPPED law stands in the spec,
the formal index, and the base rulebook, and that it stays distinct from the queue-take trigger re-scan
(INV-129) rather than folding into it. Zero dependencies; run from the repo root:
    python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_resume_rederive.py
Red proven against HEAD 31a2bb3, where none of these strings exist yet.
