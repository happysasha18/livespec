"""Crossing the instance->engine boundary -- provenance and naming (SPEC INV-119, row 276).

A feature usually proves itself first on a live instance and then generalizes into the
engine. When that history goes into the engine's spec, it must read as the engine's own
record: a reconciliation log citing the engine's own public commits, never a private
instance's commit or the instance's own locale label standing as a mechanism name.
