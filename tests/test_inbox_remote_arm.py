"""The inbox door has a remote arm — M-251 (SPEC INV-112, row 247).

The owner thought the cloud seat through mid-session on 2026-07-10: today's inbox law assumes a shared
filesystem, and a cloud session, a scheduled routine, or another machine reaches a repo only through git.
The remote arm states the deposit — one new file in inbox/, committed touching inbox/ only with the source
named, then pushed — under a per-repo grant recorded in the host profile like the push grant. A seat with no
grant fails honestly: it names the grant it lacks and hands the owner the one action that supplies it. String
rows on the law's three prose homes plus the spec anchor and its index row.
