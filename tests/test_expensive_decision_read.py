"""An expensive decision earns an adversarial read before it lands (ROADMAP row 395, SPEC INV-235).

Agent birth [T-22] says the owner ratifies a new agent, and says nothing about what he ratifies ON:
the proposal names the capability, the zone, and the contracts, and it carries no adversarial read.
The class of EXPENSIVE decisions — the ones whose reversal costs more than the decision itself — has no
stated way to be decided at all. Row 395 names that class, sweeps its members, states the road from
pieces the pack already owns, and has agent birth carry it (the owner's word, 2026-07-17, continuing the
multi-agent thread).

An expensive decision cannot be told from an ordinary one by a machine — no gate reads a decision's
reversal cost — so this is a STATED DUTY at the named decision points, and this module is the
traceability proof that those points name the read. No new pre-push gate letter: the duty rides the
suite here, the way the far-tier and node-growth checks ride the suite and mint no push-gate letter.

Red-first: against HEAD 35069ba the spec carries no INV-235, the road pieces are cited nowhere as a
class, and T-22 names no adversarial read, so every assertion below fails — the red recorded in
docs/prover/2026-07-18-row395-expensive-decision.md.

Re-pinned for the requirements-format PRODUCT_SPEC.md (row 445 stage 3): the law used to live as one
prose paragraph per invariant, so a single `line_with()` match sufficed. The new format spreads a law
across a Context paragraph and several numbered acceptance criteria under one `## Requirement N:`
heading, so the needles below match anywhere within that whole requirement's body (heading through
the next `## Requirement` or `## Reference`), and per-code anchors are checked as bare codes since
criteria now share one combined `[..]` tag list rather than one bracket per code.
