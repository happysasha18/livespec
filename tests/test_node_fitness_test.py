"""A new or carved architecture node proves itself by three questions — row 260a (SPEC INV-122).

Every extraction or new/carved node is gated by a three-question fitness test at its birth: can it be
tested alone, does a real second place need it, can it and its neighbour be worked in parallel without
queuing on shared files — three yes make it right, two no make it premature. First home: build-pipeline's
architecture step (the gate a new node passes). Second home: product-prover, extending the
speculative-node flag — a node with one caller and no promised second is flagged.
