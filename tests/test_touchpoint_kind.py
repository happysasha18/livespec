"""Every point of contact with the person has a kind, and the kind decides what may be said there
(SPEC INV-205, ROADMAP 413).

The frame this row states is the HOME four scattered rows were missing — the waiting list [408], the
parked question with its default taken [409], the release note's offer of next steps [402], and the far
tier's rare self-surfacing [403]. Each names a touchpoint and its kind under one frame:

  * SYNCHRONOUS — the person is present and the work waits on him (a live question, a decision page he is
    looking at now). It affords an interruption, a wait, and a teaching line.
  * ASYNCHRONOUS — he reads on his own clock while the work rolls (a status line, the resume file, an
    inbox note, the waiting list he opens on request). It never affords an interruption; it affords a
    teaching line only where the person OPENS it himself.

The machine: each touchpoint declares its kind in a small manifest (`guardrails/touchpoints.json`), and
the gate (`guardrails/check-touchpoint-kind.py`) reds a surface that speaks in a kind its touchpoint
lacks — an interruption raised from an asynchronous point, or a teaching line on a point the person did
not open. A genuine touchpoint passes quiet.
