"""A fix touching a spec-backed literal owes its docs and test the same session — M-239 (SPEC INV-104, row 225).

Born of the row 220 audit (2026-07-10): one-line fixes touching spec-backed literals kept shipping
without same-session doc sync. The rules already existed (docs travel with the change; the red-first
small-fix path); the gap was a tripwire at build-pipeline's bug and skip doors, so the door step itself
asks whether the edit touches a spec-backed literal or clause, and a yes routes the docs-and-test duty
into the same session mechanically. His 2026-07-10 ~11:00 word queued row 225; landed 2026-07-12. String
rows on the law's two homes plus the spec anchor and its index row.
