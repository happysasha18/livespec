"""The architecture → prove seam and the Prover-record append-duty — row 273 (SPEC INV-116).

INV-116 sends ARCHITECTURE.md into the prover at every M-1 and M-6 gate, the exact analogue of the
named `spec → prove` seam. Two gaps trailed the law (fresh prover pass, 2026-07-12 s38, findings
F-arch-1/F-arch-2): the Seams table carried no `architecture → prove` row, and nothing in the gate
walk said an architecture pass appends its row to the architecture's Prover record table, so the table
drifted. This closes both.
