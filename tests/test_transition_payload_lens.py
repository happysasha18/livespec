"""INV-168 — every stated transition triggers the prover's standing transition-payload lens.

For every transition the spec states, the parameters a person perceives across it must be enumerated:
where focus and selection land, what scroll or playback position holds, whether sound continues,
whether a timer keeps running, whether a shown value is fresh or stale. A parameter the spec leaves
blank is answered by the platform default alone, and a default that silently becomes the behaviour
leaves the topology lenses no written text to read. The motion-parity lens [INV-165] and the
entry-state lens [INV-167] are instances this parent lens generalizes.

These tests assert the spec states the lens and the product-prover skill carries it, so the standing
lens is real text a reviewer runs by construction rather than a note in a journal.
