"""Declared cross-cutting laws: one home, a prover station, an author habit — M-237 (SPEC INV-101, row 223).

His 2026-07-10 ~10:38 word from the worked miss: analytics covered some beats while whole
surfaces emitted nothing, and only his eye found it. The spec names its cross-cutting laws in
one declared-laws home; every new surface's section states its line against each declared law
(the clause or a dated exemption) before the prover reads it; the prover's station enumerates
every surface and transition per declared law. String rows on the three homes.
