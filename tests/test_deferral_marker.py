"""The deferral-marker gate — the mechanical net for INV-152 (SPEC).

Rule 29 / INV-152 already says: writing a needs-the-human's-word marker requires
naming the human-only fact, and a marker that cannot name it defaults to the seat.
Until now that was discipline only. This gate is its mechanical arm, the same shape
as INV-155's retry-plugin grep: a defer marker in a resume/decision file that names
no reason category (taste / policy / irreversible / device-feel) is a finding, and
the commit is blocked on it. A negated mention ("NOT owner-reserved") is not a marker.

Zero dependencies beyond the stdlib; run from the repo root:
  python3 -m pytest -q tests
