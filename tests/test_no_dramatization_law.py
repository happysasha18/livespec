"""No dramatization, in either direction (ROADMAP row 383, SPEC INV-221).

Grading the size of a change — its importance or drama, up or down — is the reader's act, never the
writer's. The profile holds the personal value (no-inflation, both directions); the pack owes the general
law every host inherits, and it binds every text — chat, docs, worker reports, and agent-to-agent messages.

The class already has its machine: the register judge (SPEC INV-203) reads it on the chat and document
surfaces, with the literal overlays as the free first pass. This row builds only the genuinely-remaining
part — the pack-level law statement, and the worker-brief clause carrying it to the one surface the judge
does not read (a worker's own report and its agent-to-agent messages). So this module proves the law
stands in its homes, proves the worker brief carries it, and proves the judge mechanism reds a graded-size
sentence at BOTH poles, rather than rebuilding a machine the register judge already is.

Red-first: at the pre-delta tree (HEAD c93e987) the SPEC carries no INV-221 and the delegation guidance
names no no-dramatization law, so the law/clause assertions fail — that is the red (recorded in the prover
record 2026-07-18).
