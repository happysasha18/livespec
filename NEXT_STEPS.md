# live-spec — NEXT_STEPS (resume file: LIVE STATE + queue only; history → JOURNAL.md; ≤100 lines, INV-48)

## LIVE STATE (2026-07-23 night — row 456 LANDED at v4.3.0; the format family is complete)
The architecture became the format family's fourth member (row 456, v4.3.0). ARCHITECTURE.md is now
per-node `### [node: <name>]` sections under `docs/architecture-format.md`, read through the one node
reader `guardrails/archformat.py`; the dated prover-record table relocated to
`docs/prover/architecture-prover-record.md`; six behavioral rules moved from owns cells into their spec
clauses; requirements 289-291 (INV-278/279/280) added; 17 consumers repointed to the reader; the doc shed
31 KB (107 to 76 KB). The two-stage content-preservation proof passed (nothing substantive lost or
invented). The fresh-context MINOR gate ran a prover + adversarial audit + design-review parity: two
blocking findings (the pin-drift check still slicing the raw shape in shell behind a Python-only test; the
Decisions section's dangling "prover record below" pointers) and two should-fix findings folded before the
landing. Suite green. Record: `docs/prover/2026-07-23-row456.md`.

With the spec (4.0.0), matrix (4.1.0), roadmap (4.2.0), and architecture (4.3.0) all converted, the
format family is complete. **tlvphotos migrates next on his word from its own window; other projects
stand until then.**

## Near queue
- Row 483: the four pre-existing architecture-doc reader stumbles the row-456 cold read surfaced
  (feature-coverage prose vs table on guardrails; two gates both lettered "gate x"; "Formal index"
  retired-vs-live terminology; the spec-author self-seam) — each resolved or recorded as an agreed
  non-problem. Small doc-cleanup.
- Row 481: the live-queue staleness sweep at the milestone gate (his 2026-07-23 word: the roadmap is no
  five-year plan); threshold [default: 30 days queued, 7 days in-work quiet]; owns the two deferred rows
  still trigger-less (143, 144) and the stale in-work claims 386/412 (quiet since 07-18, sweep-eligible
  07-25).
- Row 482: mid-turn chat lines reach the human ungated (his catch 2026-07-23 ~21:20) — the register nets
  must read narration lines, not only the turn's final message; the fix is a machine.
- Rows 471-475 (row 470's children; 475 the class answer — the enforcement-coverage registry).
- Rows 465-467 · row 437 pulled near (axis forcing step first, the recursive sweep its dear half) · row
  460 re-scoped (his 2026-07-23 word: public tier only; working tier possibly-never with two named
  triggers) · row 469 · row 479 (worker tree-restore guard).

## RECOMMENDATION carried from the row-456 prover (not blocking)
R290.1's "at most one parenthetical sentence" has no length/count gate; a few owns cells carry
multi-clause parentheticals. Candidate to fold into row 483's doc-cleanup.

## FIRST at intake — classify one-time vs standing (Alexander 2026-07-21, ROADMAP 440)
Name every request's persistence class before actioning it, and say it yourself.

## Standing word / OWNER-HELD
- Whole movement solo, push on green; plain English in docs, plain Russian in chat; gates mandatory.
- Max agentic, conserve orchestrator context (delegate reads and drafts; hold briefs and decisions).
- lean-orchestrator: the seat authors nothing long and reads nothing past a glance inline.
- Push on green is his grant; re-test every "needs his word" by derivability first; re-derive deferred
  state from the code itself (INV-247), setting any stale resume note aside.
- Row 421 (open, Alexander's call): one window ruling several instance-agents vs the one-window law.
- Budget word (2026-07-23): the two remaining formats fit; rows 460+437's expensive halves wait for the
  weekly reset. The format family is now done, so that spend closed.

## CONCURRENCY — multiple windows share ~/live-spec
Commit narrowly by explicit path, never git add -A; re-check HEAD before writing; re-arm with
guardrails/fence-refresh.sh after accounting for a move. The spec freeze re-baselines at each landing
commit (python3 scripts/spec-freeze.py --freeze PRODUCT_SPEC.md ARCHITECTURE.md TEST_MATRIX.md
--compaction). A closing commit moves its row to the archive via
`python3 scripts/rotate-doc.py --doc ROADMAP.md --close-row N` and touches this file (INV-242).

## Migration readiness
The format family is complete (all four core documents converted). tlvphotos migrates on his word from its
own window. Onboarding (movement 3) stays deferred on ~8 taste forks; framework coexistence and the
"superpower" positioning stay open questions.

## Open movements
CLOSED: row 456 architecture format v4.3.0 · row 480 queue format v4.2.0 · row 477 matrix format v4.1.0 ·
rows 461-464 audit should-fix batch v4.0.1 · row 445 spec format v4.0.0 · conduct audit v3.1.0 ·
comms/naming v3.0.0 · axes-from-kind v3.2.0.
DEFERRED: adoption + onboarding (his 2026-07-18 word; ~8 taste forks; owns the parameters registry, 427).

## Queue's open head (field-gated + far tier)
385 first real contract · 389 cross-machine read · 247 remote-deposit field leg · 396/405 conversation
channel + listener (wait on the harness listener, INV-231) · far tier 381, 411, 435. Runnable head is
field-gated (contract/listener) + far tier.

## Next free codes
Next free INV-281, E-36, T-25, M-457; next ROADMAP row 484 (A-12, B-4, C-2, D-8, S-1, ACT-4 also free).

## Research in hand
Direct-protocol research (scratchpad research-agent-transport.md + research-direct-channel.md): A2A
re-invents our card; prior art docs/research/2026-07-17-agent-routing-prior-art.md.
